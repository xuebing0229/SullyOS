Original prompt: 先继续优化都市人生 simsapp：去掉 pics 里的丑像素家具/房屋贴图，改成自己画的像素图；并把“吃瓜”从单纯调用 API 引导 char 行动，升级为随机触发“角色剧情”或“主线剧情”，主线剧情要有明显标题和附件栏，附件可包含图片、道具、证据、同人文等。

2026-03-19
- Removed the hardcoded building PNG override in `utils/tinyTownTiles.ts` so LifeSim now uses generated pixel-style town tiles instead of `pics` house textures.
- Added story attachment types, world-drama prompt helpers, fallback attachment generation, and `materializeStoryAttachments` so main-plot events can drop image/item/evidence/fanfic payloads.
- Added `apps/lifesim/StoryAttachments.tsx` for compact attachment cards plus a modal detail viewer.
- Wired `apps/LifeSimApp.tsx` so `吃瓜` now randomly branches into either normal char-driven drama or a no-char main-plot event from `主线编剧室`.
- Seeded replay actions correctly for the new branch and moved `runCharTurns` above the user action handlers to avoid referencing it before initialization.
- Added a no-API fallback for char turns so the sim no longer gets stuck when external model settings are empty; chars will still produce lightweight “围观” replay entries.
- Updated the drama feed and replay overlay to surface main-plot badges, headlines, and attachment shelves.
- `npm run build` passes after the LifeSim changes.
- Automated Playwright validation is currently blocked because `C:\Users\tiaotiao\.codex\skills\develop-web-game\scripts\web_game_playwright_client.js` cannot resolve the `playwright` package in this environment.
- Added drama filters (`全部 / 角色 / 主线 / 系统`) and changed the normal drama log to keep the full scrollable history instead of truncating to 50.
- Added a LifeSim settings panel for selecting which external characters are allowed to participate in the sim.
- Added long-press NPC editing so residents can be edited in-place for this run (name / gender / personality / bio / backstory).
- Replaced the browser-native reset confirm with a custom retro dialog that can either reset directly or generate a LifeSim ending summary card before resetting.
- Added a new `lifesim_reset_card` score-card payload and wired it through chat rendering plus readable archive/context formatting in Chat / Character / chat prompt history.
- Text attachments like fanfic/evidence now surface the original text as the primary reading area in the attachment modal.
- Adjusted `apps/lifesim/DramaFeed.tsx` so main-plot actions also remain visible in the left-hand dynamic stream under `全部 / 主线`, instead of being excluded from `drama.log`.
- Restyled the LifeSim reset summary card in `components/chat/MessageItem.tsx` to look more like the game's retro pseudo-window UI (sharper borders, title bar, grid texture, status bar).
- `npm run build` still passes after the latest DramaFeed + chat-card styling changes.
- Automated browser validation is still blocked locally because `require('playwright')` fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

2026-08-17 — Qixi visual retheme
- Current request: rebuild the Qixi entry screen to match the supplied celestial poster reference, then retheme the in-game surfaces using the supplied deep-purple / lavender / blush-gold fantasy palette.
- Constraints: preserve the existing Qixi memory-generation and smart-context behavior; visual/layout changes only unless a UI integration fix is required.
- Visual thesis: a full-screen storybook night poster with deep plum space, lavender mist, cream moonlight, and restrained blush-gold ornament.
- Planned validation: Qixi entry at mobile and desktop sizes, then fake chat and first interlayer screens; inspect screenshots, render_game_to_text, and console errors.

- Removed LifeSim's autonomous NPC interaction step from the main turn flow, so only user-triggered actions and char/main-plot API turns advance the story now.
- Added LifeSim-specific independent API settings with global preset loading and a Gemini Flash recommendation, and persisted them on the LifeSim state so city resets do not wipe the app-specific config.
- Reworked `apps/lifesim/DramaFeed.tsx` again so `主线历史` appears above the current main-plot detail view, while keeping the archive separate from the general drama stream.
- Tightened LifeSim scroll behavior across the main panel, settings panel, action panel, and attachment viewer by hiding scrollbars and blocking horizontal overflow except for the attachment strip itself.
- `npm run build` passes after the latest LifeSim logic + layout + settings changes.

TODO
- If local browser testing is possible, verify both `吃瓜 -> 角色剧情` and `吃瓜 -> 主线剧情` paths and inspect attachment modal behavior.
- Install or provide `playwright` if automated screenshot-based UI validation is needed later.

2026-03-21
- Added a new global chat appearance setting, [0mchatAvatarMode[0m, so users can choose between grouped avatars and showing an avatar on every message.
- Rebuilt components/appearance/ChatAppearanceEditor.tsx into a clean modular version and updated the live preview so repeated-message avatar behavior is visible before applying.
- Wired the new avatar mode into pps/Chat.tsx and components/chat/MessageItem.tsx, including React.memo comparisons so appearance toggles reliably re-render existing messages.
- 
pm run build passes after the chat-avatar-frequency changes.
- Playwright validation is still blocked locally because the skill client cannot resolve the playwright package in this environment (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND).

- Updated chat message grouping in pps/Chat.tsx so consecutive messages now split not only by sender role but also by a 30-minute time gap, preventing early messages from visually merging into much later ones on either side of the conversation.
- 
pm run build passes after the time-gap grouping fix.

2026-08-17 — Qixi visual retheme completed
- Rebuilt the Qixi entry screen as a full-screen celestial storybook poster with visible brand/exit, moon phases, oversized title, oval CTA, and status copy.
- Applied a cohesive deep-plum, lavender, blush, and cream-moonlight palette through fake chat, distortion, interlayer, exploration, core, touch, and ending screens without changing story or memory logic.
- Verified the desktop entry and the mobile cover → fake chat → distortion → interlayer entry → first exploration sequence with rendered screenshots; no console or page errors were reported.
- `utils/qixiMemoryBundle.test.ts` passes (2 tests) and the production build succeeds.

2026-08-17 — Qixi dual-layer story rewrite
- Original prompt for this rewrite: read `qixi_reworked (1).md`, expand the inadequate 2–5 memory-anchor design, and implement the approved Qixi rewrite list.
- Visual thesis: a deep-plum context interlayer where User and Char are represented by two restrained text colors, with one shared ritual object dominating each full-screen scene.
- Content plan: preserve the celestial entry/fake chat/rabbit door, then run seven evidence-backed dual-layer rituals, form the bridge, reveal Char for the first time, hold to touch, and return to ordinary chat.
- Interaction thesis: the other-layer color gradually appears; shared objects visibly move from the unseen side; seven traces converge into one bridge transition. Keep copy and controls sparse.
- Implementation order: v2 material schema and recall, v7 game state/scenes, reunion generation and portrait fallback, touch/return-to-chat, tests/build/Playwright screenshots.
- Do not fabricate memories to satisfy anchor counts. Rich context targets 12–18 evidence anchors (cap 24); sparse context degrades personalization instead.

TODO — Qixi rewrite
- Replace qixi memory bundle v1 and invalidate stale per-character cache.
- Replace fixed NPC nodes, early reveal copy, 5+3 hidden gate, fixed four-page core, finalEcho, long touch monologue, and repeated ending thesis.
- Preserve the existing full-screen art direction and deterministic `render_game_to_text` / `advanceTime` hooks.

2026-08-17 — Qixi v2 material layer
- Replaced the 2–5-anchor v1 bundle with evidence (target 12–18, cap 24), typed artifacts (cap 40), seven scene payloads, per-scene personalization flags, and context-signature cache invalidation.
- Expanded source gathering to 160 recent messages plus three focused memory-palace recalls covering difficult emotions, wishes/future, and daily objects/language.
- Added local per-scene fallback content so sparse/invalid model output does not invent memories or make the activity unplayable.
- Added parser tests for rich evidence retention, hard caps/provenance filtering, and sparse response rejection. All 3 assertions pass; Vitest then hits an environment-only EPERM writing `node_modules/.vite/vitest/results.json`.

2026-08-17 — Qixi dual-layer rewrite implemented and browser-verified
- Replaced the old exploration/core/final-echo structure with a v7 flow: celestial cover, fake chat, CSS white-rabbit door, interlayer entry, seven shared-object scenes, bridge, generated reunion, hold-to-touch, short ending, and return to ordinary chat.
- Each of the seven scenes now has its own dominant CSS/SVG object, User action, independently rendered other-layer action, reveal, and saved decision; the word-cloud scene requires three selections and supports separate User/Char colors.
- Added a separate final reunion generator with technical-language and coercive-promise filtering plus portrait priority `Live2D -> meeting sprite -> static avatar -> chibi/initial fallback`.
- The ending saves one deduplicated assistant chat message, marks the special-moment record complete, selects the character, opens Chat, and now auto-returns reliably even when the OS parent re-renders.
- Added image-load fallback, removed a visible `Char` placeholder from sparse-context copy, replaced the missing-glyph rabbit with a CSS silhouette, and made bridge line angles valid CSS variables.
- `utils/qixiMemoryBundle.test.ts` and `utils/qixiReunion.test.ts` pass together (5 tests) with Vitest `--no-cache`.
- Full desktop flow and mobile flow were exercised in the in-app Browser, including early-release feedback, sustained 1.25s touch, generated/fallback reunion, portrait loading, automatic chat return, and persisted return message.
- The standalone skill Playwright client remains unavailable because its local package import fails; in-app Browser validation was used as the supported fallback.
- Production build passes with 6,100 modules transformed when emitted to an isolated output directory; the temporary build output was removed afterward.

2026-08-17 — Qixi second-round interaction rewrite
- Current request: reduce fixed exposition, make Char's parallel exploration discoverable through User-triggered object changes, add Flappy Char during memory loading, generate the opening chat, generate a real-memory bridge as Part 2, and rebuild the final promise/touch as cross-layer pinky-link interaction.
- Visual thesis: one plum context layer with warm rose-gold for User actions and cool moon-blue for Char actions; the second color changes shared objects instead of narrating who is present.
- Content plan: memory loading game → accidental chat glitch → leaked memory fragments → seven shared-object interactions → evidence-backed bridge nodes → dynamic portrait reunion → cross-layer promise.
- Interaction thesis: words can be removed/completed, cards physically flip, objects visibly move twice, and both layer colors converge on the final hold point.
- Part 1 is now v3 and generates the two-line accidental opening alongside seven evidence-backed scenes; recall uses four Qixi-specific query families covering longing/contact, daily objects/language, effort/future, and difficult emotions.
- Added a playable canvas-based Flappy Char loading stage with explicit long-wait copy, natural landing after materials are ready, and deterministic `advanceTime` support.
- Replaced immediate scene exposition with a persisted User → Char → complete beat state; leaked phrases can be touched/taken, wish cards flip, thread/offerings/water/market/word-cloud objects visibly change in the second color.
- Added Part 2 `qixiBridge.ts`: it reuses Part 1 evidence without a second recall, rejects unknown evidence IDs, and exposes each real memory as a player-placed bridge node.
- Part 3 now reuses the Part 1 bundle, emits separate Live2D/meeting expression cues for arrival/reflection/blessing/promise, and generates a natural promise invitation before the final cross-layer pinky hold.
- Part 1/2/3 parser tests pass: 3 files, 7 tests. Project-wide `tsc --noEmit` still reports pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, update/github tests, apiCallLog, builtin Live2D, userCameraEmotion, and vite proxy types; no Qixi errors were reported.
- Final browser QA completed for the full 19-step path at 390×844 and 1280×800. Both runs reached the ending with zero console/page errors; the official web-game Playwright client also exercised the Flappy loading canvas and deterministic state hook.
- Visual QA caught and fixed four interaction regressions: wish-card letters inheriting the center glyph positioning, bridge nodes losing pointer hits, the mobile bridge grid centering its first node outside the scroll hit area, and pinky hands receiving invalid percentage coordinates.
- Final focused Vitest run passes (3 files, 7 tests). Worker bundles build successfully and the Vite production build passes with 6,101 modules transformed.

2026-08-17 — Qixi ChatApp card and replay entry
- A completed fresh run now saves a structured `qixi_event_card` immediately before Char's ordinary private-chat return line. Both messages share a per-run id and use adjacent timestamps, so retries deduplicate without reversing their order.
- The card stores the generated opening, all seven User/Char object interactions, evidence-backed bridge nodes, reunion lines, blessing, and pinky-promise text. Chat prompts read it in second person (`你经历了一次奇怪的空间坍缩…`); archive and memory formatting retain the same full journey in third person.
- The special-moment record now carries the complete v8 replay snapshot. Selecting a character with a completed record opens a two-choice dialog: replay the same material without LLM/chat writes, or force a fresh Part 1 generation while keeping the old record until the new run completes.
- Added locally styled replay-choice and Qixi ChatApp card surfaces so these new screens remain legible even when the project's runtime Tailwind CDN is unavailable.
- Browser QA verified choice → replay cover → replay opening chat and activity-card → private-line ordering at 390×844 with zero console/page errors. The official web-game client also exercised the fresh Flappy canvas after this change.
- Qixi focused tests pass: 4 files, 10 tests. Vite production build passes with 6,104 modules transformed. Project-wide TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors; no Qixi/Valentine/qixiChatCard error was added.

2026-08-17 — Qixi reunion and promise prompt split
- Replaced the short final-reunion prompt with the requested four-beat structure: immediate arrival reaction, optional worldview-safe meta, a new 2–5 line `companionshipReflection` about recognizing/thinking of each other, and a non-farewell Qixi blessing.
- Removed the duplicated/conflicting pasted draft from the actual prompt: the first version is authoritative, so blessings are not forced toward “a future without Char,” and technical identity follows each character’s existing worldview.
- Split generation into two model requests. `qixi-reunion-part3a-v3` creates the three portrait stages and reunion copy; `qixi-promise-part3b-v1` separately creates invitation/hold/complete, the promise portrait cue, and the ordinary ChatApp return line.
- The reunion UI now conditionally skips an empty meta page, adds a dedicated “想起彼此” page, then proceeds to blessing and the separately generated pinky promise.
- Qixi chat cards/context now retain meta and companionship reflection so Char can remember the emotional discovery after returning to private chat.
- Focused Qixi tests pass: 4 files, 11 tests. `tsc --noEmit` and the Vite production build pass (6,104 modules transformed).
- Official web-game Playwright plus a mobile 390×844 audit verified companionship → blessing → promise state transitions and screenshots with zero console/page errors.

2026-08-17 — Qixi round-two finale, BGM, and generation pipeline
- Added four random-per-run Qixi BGM groups using the supplied `SullyOS-assets/bgm/qixi` tracks and the existing multi-CDN audio fallback. Routing is: fracture/scene 01 → group 01, scenes 02–04 → group 02, scenes 05–07 → group 03, then bridge/reunion/promise/ending continuously on group 04 without a touch-stage cut.
- Removed timed auto-advance from the seven room interactions. User results and Char-side changes now each remain until the player explicitly continues, with larger mobile text surfaces and the Char action repeated in a readable interaction panel.
- Replaced Part 2's object stepping-stone bridge with evidence-validated User/Char memory magpies, two-bank flight tracks, needle-like woven lines, a Char-side final magpie named after the User, a bridge-connection beat, and a short crossing transition.
- Rebuilt the penultimate stage as a real galgame presentation: Live2D first, then the exact DateApp active-skin/base sprite map and `spriteConfig`, followed only by static/chibi fallback. Arrival/reflection/blessing expressions drive the full-screen portrait while one LLM line advances per click.
- Reworked the promise visual into a two-color hold interaction with converging thread paths, a completed knot, a post-release breathing beat, and a dark continuity fade back to ordinary ChatApp.
- Part 1 now immediately starts Part 2 after success, and Part 2 immediately starts Part 3 after success. All Qixi model calls use zero automatic retries; Part 1/2/3 failures stop on a modal and require an explicit user retry.
- Added BGM routing and memory-magpie contract tests. Focused Qixi verification passes: 5 files, 15 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,106 modules transformed; project-wide TypeScript still reports the previously known unrelated errors and no Qixi error.
- Official web-game client and a custom 390×844 Edge audit covered room User/Char beats, both bridge banks and final magpie, DateApp meeting-sprite arrival/reflection, touch-ready/joined/released states, and deterministic state output. The audit's only console entries were expected remote BGM load failures in the network-restricted test sandbox; no JavaScript page error occurred.

2026-08-18 — Qixi generation-state and room-transition repair
- Root-caused the fresh-run Part 2 dead wait: `enterInterlayer()` replaced the whole game object with `freshGame()`, deleting bridge/reunion results that had already completed in the background.
- Changed room entry to preserve the current session, and added independent bridge/reunion result refs so future gameplay state transitions cannot erase prefetched Part 2/3 outputs. Bridge/reunion gates restore from those refs when needed.
- Reduced Qixi memory recall from four complete Memory Palace pipeline passes to one structured multi-topic recall. Flappy now mounts only after recall completes and covers the subsequent model-generation wait.
- Added Part 1 v4 `transitionLines` for all seven rooms. Each room now has a dedicated `sceneTransition` beat and explicit Continue action; Part 1 is rejected if any room omits its generated interstitial.
- Added deterministic state output for transition copy and independent Part 2/3 readiness, plus a regression test proving room 01 entry preserves already-generated bridge/reunion data.
- Audio playback now prioritizes GitHub Raw byte-range responses, avoiding jsDelivr's repository-size rejection and Statically's MP3 403 path.
- Focused verification passes: 6 files / 27 tests, full `tsc --noEmit`, and Vite production build (6,107 modules). The browser-control runtime was unavailable in this session, so no new screenshot claim was made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room beat, word-turn, portrait, and touch polish
- Split room 01 into an explicit three-beat sequence: show the User-side delivery result, Continue to dismiss it, then expose the leaked lines for touch. The User result can no longer cover the target text.
- Added Part 1 v5 `charVisibleText`. Every room must now generate the exact short text/mark that appears on the shared object; a descriptive `charAction` without visible content is rejected. Room 01 renders the blue core instruction directly over the failed-message object.
- Replaced every remaining “看清这个变化” action with “继续”.
- Changed the grape-arbor word cloud from three User picks followed by one bulk Char reveal to a locked turn exchange: one warm User pick, a 720 ms blue Char reply, then the next User turn. Added a pure state guard and regression coverage for waiting, duplicate picks, and the three-turn cap.
- Corrected final portrait runtime priority to Live2D → DateApp active/base meeting sprite → the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi → initial. The neural-link avatar is no longer a reunion fallback. Added resource-order tests.
- Replaced the literal pinky/hands UI with one restrained two-color breathing orb labeled “快来碰碰这里”; long-press draws both traces into the orb. Promise prompting no longer forces a pinky or hand pose.
- Added a warm visible ending beat, “七夕快乐，{User}。”, before returning to normal ChatApp.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844 verified room 01 before/after dismissal, readable blue core content, word-cloud User/Char alternation, the new touch orb, and DateApp portrait selection (`usesMeetingPortrait: true`, `usesNeuralAvatar: false`). No Qixi runtime/page errors appeared.
- Added one shared light-repair JSON reader to Part 1/2/3. It accepts fences/prose, trailing commas, comments, smart or single quote delimiters, full-width structural punctuation, bare keys, common result wrappers, and lightly unclosed final containers; the existing schema, memory-provenance, and safety validation still runs afterward.
- Focused verification passes: 7 files / 36 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed. Project-wide `tsc --noEmit` currently reports unrelated pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, several utilities/tests, and Vite proxy typing; after updating the Qixi bundle-version fixture, it reports no Qixi source error.
2026-08-18 — Qixi Chibi scale and lost-layer blue rewrite
- Matched the Qixi Chibi fallback to the 520 conversation-stage sizing rule: 70% of usable width with a hard 230px cap. The same cap now applies in both the galgame reunion and the final touch scene instead of scaling Chibi to 66%–83% of the viewport height.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v6 and added a required lost-layer `charMutter`, so the hurried complaint is generated in the current Char's voice while `charVisibleText` remains the exact readable blue rewrite.
- Rebuilt scene 01's Char beat as a timed visual sequence: system failure first, faint blue muttering, three hand-drawn blue strike strokes across the error, sequential removal of the first three negative fragments, then the blue core sentence rewrites in place. The explanatory Continue panel is delayed until that visual beat has played.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844 measured the Chibi at 230×329 in both reunion and touch, captured the lost-layer animation mid-erasure and after rewrite, and found no application console errors on the direct QA page. The iframe-only mobile harness produced a browser instrumentation MutationObserver warning, so runtime error verification was repeated on the direct page without the harness and was clean.
- Focused Qixi verification passes: 7 files, 37 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed; the isolated build output and temporary QA harness were removed.

2026-08-18 — Qixi final portrait layout and release audit
- Made Live2D reuse the desktop companion framing/crop rules and active wardrobe state instead of inventing an event-only scale. Runtime failure still falls through to DateApp art and then the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi.
- Made DateApp meeting portraits reuse the active skin/base sprite map and shared `spriteConfig` inside a bottom-aligned 90% stage. Added a small in-scene adjustment control for scale/X/Y; saving writes the same config back to the character, so DateApp and Qixi remain aligned.
- Rechecked the 520 Chibi rule in both reunion and touch: 70% usable width with a 230px cap.
- Corrected the ChatApp card/context language so memories summon magpies and their two colored flight paths weave the road; neither memory objects nor a literal pinky are described as the bridge/action anymore.
- Audited the requested flow end-to-end in code: one structured recall, Flappy only after recall, Part 1 -> Part 2 -> Part 3 background chain, zero automatic model retries, seven generated room transitions, alternating word-cloud turns, evidence-only memory magpies, Galgame portrait stages, glowing-orb hold, warm Qixi ending, Card-before-private-line ordering, and replay/fresh choices.
- Mobile and desktop browser QA rechecked the DateApp portrait stage, adjustment panel, lost-layer blue rewrite timing, Chibi scale, and touch fallback. No application console errors were found on the direct QA page.
- Final focused verification passes: 8 files / 40 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed. Full-repo TypeScript still reports unrelated pre-existing errors, but none remain in Qixi source/tests.

2026-08-18 — Qixi pre-release detail pass
- Current request: remove duplicated Flappy loading copy; add a User-selected layer color and Part 1-generated Char color; declutter and restage room 01; redesign the double-wish card and make Char's wish genuinely their own; remove meaningless blue overlay copy from later rooms; strengthen room object animation; remove Live2D from the finale in favor of DateApp meeting portraits then Chibi; match portrait expressions per dialogue line; and make the final Qixi greeting click-to-dismiss.
- Visual thesis: preserve the plum celestial archive, but give every mobile viewport one visual object, one readable response, and one action at a time.
- Interaction thesis: room 01 becomes touch-word → delivery error → Char pushes the error away; later rooms communicate the other layer through object motion rather than floating explanatory text.
- Implemented six User layer-color choices on the cover. Part 1 v7 now generates a contrasting Char color from character personality rather than gender, plus a bounded performance profile (`tempo`, `markStyle`, `presence`) that changes motion timing, arrival force, brightness, and the shape/strength of the other-layer trace. This is the anti-cookie-cutter layer on top of the fixed seven-room skeleton.
- Simplified Flappy to one blue generation-status line. Rebuilt room 01 as direct fragment touch → immediate `DELIVERY FAILED` → Char-colored overwrite/erasure, with no overlapping preliminary Continue beat.
- Rebuilt the double-wish object as a two-sided paper/seal card. The front keeps the User's selected wish; the generated back must be the Char's own serious wish and is rejected if it is system copy or merely a blessing addressed to the User.
- Removed generated floating blue copy from the five later rooms. Their Char beat is now visible through room-specific object animation plus the generated Char trace; thread, offerings, reflection, night-market, and vine rooms each gained a dedicated visual response.
- Removed Live2D from the finale. Runtime priority is DateApp active/base meeting expressions → the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi → initial placeholder, and Part 3 now generates an expression key for every individual reunion/promise line. Parser filtering preserves source indexes so expressions cannot slip onto the wrong surviving line.
- Replaced the timed ending exit with an explicit click action; “七夕快乐” stays until the User dismisses it.
- Focused verification: 3 files / 17 tests passed with cache disabled. Vite production build succeeded with 6,108 modules transformed. Full-repo TypeScript still reports the known unrelated errors, with no Qixi source/test error. In-app browser QA at 390×844 confirmed the six-color cover and selection state with no application errors; later-room visual replay was not triggered automatically because that would send the local character's memories to the configured model.

2026-08-18 — Qixi wish-card overflow and Char quip pass
- Removed the wish seal from document flow and moved it to a small, faint bottom-right watermark. A long mobile wish now remains fully inside the paper with roughly 100px of measured space below it; the 19px seal does not intersect the text.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v8 and added generated `charQuips`: thread/offerings/reflection/night-market rooms require 1–2 short in-character remarks, while the three word-cloud exchanges require one remark per turn. Lost-layer and double-wish keep their dedicated mutter/wish copy instead.
- Kept quips out of the shared object. They appear in the lower Char response area, with `charAction` demoted to a compact two-line stage direction, preserving the earlier decision to remove explanatory blue overlays.
- Prompt direction asks for role-faithful odd metaphors, crooked logic, deadpan or teasing energy at roughly 7/10 “radio-wave” intensity, and rejects generic system explanations or meme collage as the target style.
- Focused verification: 3 files / 18 tests passed, and Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. A temporary mobile QA page using the production Qixi CSS verified the long wish, seal geometry, two-line quip panel, and zero console warnings/errors; the QA page was removed afterward. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi visual quips and personality word-cloud correction
- Moved generated Char quips out of the lower response panel and into the shared visual/object area where players are already watching the room animation. The lower panel now keeps only the compact object-stage direction and action.
- Corrected the grape-arbor choice to ask for three personality traits of “the person you are thinking of.” Added a dedicated `trait` artifact kind; non-trait objects, dates, topics, nicknames, wishes, and transient emotions can no longer populate this room. Char still answers each User choice by selecting a trait that describes User.
- Expanded the opening User layer palette from six to ten choices, including visible moon-white and ink-black choices, and wrapped the mobile picker into centered rows.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v9 so old word-cloud semantics and lower-panel quip layouts are not reused from cache.
- Verified the non-palace route: Qixi always calls `ContextBuilder.buildCoreContext`; with `memoryPalaceEnabled` off, `injectMemoryPalace` exits as `skipped_palace_disabled`, so vector recall is skipped but the normal role/user/worldbook/context builder remains active.
- Focused verification: 4 Qixi files / 22 tests passed. An isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed; the combined build could not rewrite a currently memory-mapped worker bundle owned by the running development process. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the quip is fully inside the 238px visual object, absent from the lower interaction panel, the personality question is explicit, and all ten colors render as a centered 5×2 grid with no horizontal overflow or console errors.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Part 1 field-level wish repair
- Identified the frequent `doubleWish.charVisibleText` failure as schema granularity rather than truncation: complete `finish_reason=stop` responses were discarded because one wish contained system-language or addressed only the User.
- Changed the JSON example from a meta placeholder to a literal first-person wish and made the prompt explicitly separate the visible wish sentence from `charAction`.
- Part 1 v10 now repairs only an invalid/missing/User-directed Char wish with the safe local self-wish, records the repair in `repairNotes`, and preserves the rest of the generated bundle instead of failing the whole run.
- Verification: 4 Qixi files / 25 tests passed, including all three wish-repair regressions. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed.

2026-08-18 — Qixi entry color step and unsigned visual quips
- Removed the ten-color palette from the cover. Fresh runs now enter a dedicated `colorSelect` stage first; confirming that color starts Part 1, while replay and resume behavior remain unchanged.
- Removed the Char name label from visual quips and changed the quote itself from white to the generated Char layer color, retaining the shared-object placement and glow.
- Clarified the lost-layer authorship audit: its interaction/choreography and anxiety direction are fixed, while Part 1 generates the evidence-backed fragments and responses; exact local phrases such as “没收到 / 是不是我说错了 / 别等了” appear only as insufficient-material or invalid-room fallback fillers.
- Verification: 4 Qixi files / 25 tests passed and the Vite production build completed with 6,109 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the separate 5×2 color page has no overflow and the visual quip contains only Char-colored quote text, no name label, fully inside the object.

2026-08-18 — Qixi single-track BGM handoff
- Replaced crossfading between BGM groups with an immediate stop/reset of the previous track followed by an incoming-only fade from silence to the normal 0.32 volume over 1.1 seconds. This removes overlap while keeping the transition soft.
- Kept music continuous when moving between rooms mapped to the same BGM group. Mute still fades out, while unmute resumes with a short fade-in.
- Added the active BGM group and mute state to `render_game_to_text` for deterministic browser QA.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 21 tests passed, and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. The real hook was exercised with fake Audio elements in the in-app browser: the old track paused and reset before the new play event, exactly one track remained active, and its volume reached 0.32; a same-group room change emitted no new audio events. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room 01 ordinary-player topic flow
- Replaced the fixed anxiety-fragment → error → Char-repairs-error sequence with a three-step player flow: choose one generated topic they want to discuss with Char, see that message become `DELIVERY FAILED`, then follow the returned text directly into room 02. Room 01 no longer has a Char beat, mutter, rewrite, or error-erasure animation.
- Renamed the room to “未送达的话题” and moved its 2–3 topic choices into the message object. Removed the fixed “没收到 / 是不是我说错了 / 别等了” fragments and all visible “普通” wording.
- Part 1 materials are now v11. The prompt requires natural day-to-day conversation topics and explicitly forbids deployment, bug-fixing, API, log, operations, or lost-contact coping actions. The parser discards technical task labels, ignores obsolete room-01 Char intervention fields, and falls back to safe conversation topics if the room still adopts a developer perspective.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 21 tests passed and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised topic selection, the failed-delivery state, and the direct transition to room 02; no Char repair copy appeared and the layout did not overflow. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room 01 choreography correction
- Corrected the prior interpretation: only the player-facing material changes from anxiety/developer copy to generated day-to-day conversation topics. The original four-beat choreography remains mandatory: choose topic → `DELIVERY FAILED` → Char rushes in from the other layer and rescues/rewrites the error → continue.
- Restored the Char beat, hurried `charMutter`, colored scribble, error-erasure animation, `REWRITING` core sentence, Char stage direction, and the separate completion click. The chosen topic shifts into Char color while unchosen topics fade, so the rescue is visible inside the object.
- Part 1 is now v12. Room 01 again requires `charAction`, `charMutter`, and `charVisibleText`, while its User options remain natural conversation topics and still reject deployment, bug-fixing, API, log, operations, and lost-contact coping actions.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 22 tests passed and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised all four beats and visually confirmed the restored Char rescue before room 02, with no overflow or render error. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Part 1 abnormal-event generation contract and later-part timeouts
- Reframed Part 1 v13 around one continuous two-person anomaly instead of seven repeated memory-display rooms. The prompt now front-loads “memory is gameplay material, not display content,” assigns a distinct relationship-progression job to every station, allows invented present-tense staging but no invented past, and explicitly requires concrete accidents, conflict, intentional choices, role-specific handling, and evidence shown through action rather than narrator conclusions.
- Kept room 01's restored choreography unchanged and restored its original “失联层 / 等待响应 / 遥寄 · 双星失联” metadata. Its generated choices must now each derive from their own real evidence reference; generic greetings, technical tasks, invalid evidence IDs, and leaked internal labels such as `e1` are rejected. If only this room is invalid, its local fallback topics are built from the parsed real evidence instead of generic questions.
- Extended Part 2 to 300 seconds per model request. Both Part 3 requests—reunion and promise—also receive 300 seconds each.
- Verification: 4 focused files / 30 tests passed with Vitest cache disabled. The final isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot start because the bundled environment lacks Playwright; the attempted in-app fallback could not reach a persistent local server, so no new visual screenshot claim is made for this prompt/timeout-only pass.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v14 error-target choreography, readable transitions, and 20-memory recall
- Corrected room 01's target without changing its four-beat flow: User chooses a real memory topic → `DELIVERY FAILED` appears → Char attacks and destroys that popup → the selected topic remains unchanged in User color. The scribble now lives inside the error element, the topic rescue/recolor animation and message-line mutation were removed, and `REWRITING` became `ERROR REMOVED`.
- Removed the literal `物件：` pseudo-label from the lower Char stage direction. Room transition headers now say `前往 02 · 双面祈愿处`, so the second Part 1 room is no longer visually confused with actual Part 2.
- Bumped Part 1 to v14. Its prompt and parser now reject Lost Layer copy that attacks, rewrites, deletes, or “rescues” User's topic; invalid room-01 text falls back locally to the correct error-target action. Generated transitions that contain technical/worldbook jargon such as `数据流`, `字符化`, `上下文`, or `【CYBERORDER】` are repaired field-by-field while the rest of the LLM scene remains intact.
- Expanded Qixi-only Memory Palace retrieval from 15 to 20 final items in both the candidate cutoff and formatter. Qixi passes an empty recent-message list to retrieval, so only its broad cross-topic activity query affects recall scoring; recent chat is still supplied separately to the Part 1 generator as a factual source. Normal chat and other callers keep the default 15-item/context-aware behavior.
- Asked Part 1 for 20 diverse evidence items across time, topic, and memory type, raised the injected-memory allowance to 40k characters, and slightly increased generation temperature to reduce replay sameness. The cache/purpose version change prevents reuse of v13 bundles.
- Verification: 11 focused files / 135 tests passed with cache disabled. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed and its temporary output was removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; the in-app browser reached the current Qixi cover at 390×844 without triggering a new external model generation.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v15 character-alive and quiet-ending pass
- Removed the visible final action copy entirely. The warm “七夕快乐” screen now stays in place and the whole screen is the click/keyboard dismissal target; no “带着这句话回去” or substitute button is rendered.
- Moved Part 1 from memory-led characterization to character-led present action. Each room uses at most one main memory anchor; personality, present accidents, hesitation, misjudgment, odd private thoughts, and handling style provide the rest of the scene life.
- Added the symmetric-trap contract: Char is caught in the context gap at the same time, has also lost User, does not know the activity or the other layer’s identity, and cannot read User’s current thoughts. At least three rooms must begin from Char’s own immediate purpose before the two sides’ actions collide or connect.
- Required private Char-colored asides in double-wish and later room visuals. The double-wish aside is a tiny paper-corner whisper beneath Char’s serious self-directed wish; invalid/missing or system-style wish asides are repaired locally without discarding the generated bundle.
- Bumped the Part 1 cache/purpose to v15 so older memory-heavy bundles are not reused.
- Verification: 4 focused Qixi files / 36 tests passed with cache disabled. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules and its output was removed. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the wish whisper remains inside the card without taking a separate layout row, the ending has no visible action button, and no Qixi error appeared. The official web-game client still cannot resolve its Playwright dependency, so the in-app browser was used for the visual pass; the temporary QA page was removed.

2026-08-18 — Beijing-time Qixi one-time launch popup
- Added a one-day launch gate for Beijing time 2026-08-19. It opens at 00:00 Asia/Shanghai, expires at the following midnight regardless of device timezone, and uses `sullyos_qixi_2026_08_19_popup_seen` as its permanent one-time state.
- Added a dedicated Qixi launch letter: restrained plum night-sky composition, two converging colored stars, a shared knot, sparse invitation copy, a primary “去赴约” action, and reduced-motion support. Opening takes the User to the existing Special Moments app without preselecting a character; dismissing keeps the activity available there.
- Integrated the popup into PhoneShell after required update notices and before ordinary maintenance/backup reminders so overlays cannot stack. Both entering and dismissing mark the push as seen.
- Verification: 6 Beijing-date/storage tests passed. Vite production build succeeded with 6,112 modules and the isolated output was removed. Mobile QA at 390×844 and 390×667 found no horizontal overflow or console errors; the temporary QA page was removed. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright, so visual verification used the in-app browser fallback.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v17 room choreography, split Part 1 generation, and expanded Part 3 dialogue
- Room 01 now keeps the User's chosen real-memory topic intact while a full red API/timeout/soft-apology wall appears; Char forcibly erases only those errors, leaves two colored private mutters around the object, and sends a topic-specific real reply through the cleared space. Room 02 requires both sides' serious shared-future wishes and prioritizes Window Sill memories. Room 04 visibly stages separate User and Char offerings before Char's aside. Every pre-word-cloud room has exactly three intentional choices.
- Split Part 1 into two actual model requests with independent five-minute timeouts and 32k output budgets: the first returns common evidence/artifacts plus rooms 01–04, and the second receives that accepted seed and returns only rooms 05–07. The chunks are merged and still pass the original full provenance/schema validation before being cached; phase-specific failures include finish reason and output size. The cache moved to v17 so no earlier single-call bundle can mask the new path.
- Expanded Part 3's portrait dialogue into a longer emotional arc. The reunion asks for 3–5 lines, companionship reflection 4–7, and blessing 4–7, with per-line DateApp expression matching retained. The generated reunion receives a 16k token budget, the final promise 8k, and the local fallback now carries the same substantial arc.
- Verification: 2 focused files / 33 tests passed with cache disabled. The final Vite production build succeeded with 6,112 modules transformed and the isolated output was removed. Mobile QA for rooms 01 and 04 had already been completed at 390×844; temporary QA pages were removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Claude 524 streaming transport fix
- Forced all five effective Qixi generation calls to request streaming independently of the global chat streaming preference: shared Part 1a/1b request body, Part 2 bridge, Part 3a reunion, and Part 3b promise. This lets compatible Claude proxies send response headers/chunks before the long JSON generation completes, avoiding the non-streaming Cloudflare 524 path without changing prompts, parsers, output budgets, or timeouts.
- Kept the existing no-automatic-retry rule for every `/chat/completions` request, so a timeout or upstream error still surfaces to the Qixi UI for explicit User regeneration and cannot silently create a second billable generation.
- Added a source-wiring regression guarding every Qixi request against `stream:false`, both Part 3 calls, the shared two-phase Part 1 path, and zero automatic retries. Focused verification passed 7 files / 59 tests, including SSE assembly for Claude/OpenRouter variants and JSON fallback when a proxy ignores streaming. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed.
- The official web-game client still cannot resolve its Playwright dependency. In-app browser fallback loaded the current app at 127.0.0.1 without entering Qixi or sending memories/model requests; the lock screen rendered normally and showed no application error (only the existing Tailwind CDN development warning).

2026-08-18 — Qixi five-call entry confirmation and color typography pass
- Confirmed the real billable generation topology is five chat-completion requests: Part 1a, Part 1b, Part 2, Part 3a, and Part 3b. Fresh runs now stop after color selection and show an explicit five-call API suitability dialog before any memory preparation or generation begins.
- The color confirmation button only opens the dialog. Generation starts only from the separate “配置没问题，开始” action; cancel and Escape return to color selection without a call. The text-state hook exposes the confirmation state and its two actions for deterministic QA.
- Rebuilt the color selection hierarchy into a quiet poster-like composition: small numbered kicker, two-scale serif heading, concise explanatory line, selected-color identity row, larger readable 5×2 swatches, and one centered confirmation action. Added restrained staggered entry, swatch lift/glow, and dialog orbit motion while retaining the existing Qixi palette.
- Added a wiring regression that derives the dialog count from the effective request bodies, so changing the generation topology without updating the UI fails the test. Focused verification passed 8 files / 62 tests. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed.
- The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright. In-app browser fallback exercised the real flow at 390×844 and 390×667: color selection updated the visible identity, the dialog showed five calls and both actions without overflow, cancel returned to the color page, no API timing log appeared, and no console error was recorded. The confirm action was intentionally not pressed, so no memories or model request left the local browser.

2026-08-18 — Qixi four-call generation topology
- Folded the former standalone Part 2 bridge request into the existing Part 1b response. The second call now returns rooms 05–07 plus evidence-backed `userMagpies`, `charMagpies`, and `finalMagpie`; bridge playback only reads that accepted payload and never opens another `/chat/completions` request.
- Reduced the real billable topology to four calls: Part 1a, Part 1b + bridge, Part 3a reunion, and Part 3b promise. The entry confirmation now displays four calls, and its wiring regression derives that number from the actual request bodies.
- Moved the memory bundle cache to v18 and require generated cached bundles to carry the embedded bridge, preventing older five-call sessions from bypassing the new generation path. The merged parser validates both banks against Part 1 evidence and fixes the final magpie name to the current User.
- Focused verification passed 8 files / 63 tests. The Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed and its isolated output was removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; in-app mobile QA at 390×667 showed the four-call dialog without overflow, cancel returned to color selection, and both API timing logs and console errors remained empty. No real generation request was sent.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Claude stream completion and four-call rebalance
- Fixed the Flappy loader hanging after a compatible Claude proxy had already finished billing/output. All four Qixi calls now use the incremental SSE reader; `[DONE]` or a terminal `finish_reason` actively cancels a proxy socket that remains open instead of waiting forever for `reader.done`. Added reproductions for both lingering-socket variants, retained zero automatic retries, and raised Qixi long-generation header timeout allowance from five to ten minutes.
- Kept four billable requests but rebalanced them for lower output pressure: Part 1a returns shared evidence plus rooms 01–02, Part 1b returns rooms 03–05, Part 1c returns rooms 06–07 plus the embedded bridge, and the finale returns reunion plus promise in one combined JSON. Existing room/reunion/promise creative instructions remain in the prompts; only phase scopes and the final combined-output envelope changed.
- Removed story spoilers from the entry warning. It now says only that the journey makes four model API calls and asks the User to check configuration/credit.
- Final focused verification passed 8 files / 66 tests, including the two never-closing SSE streams and source-derived four-call topology. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; the in-app-browser local navigation was blocked by its security auto-review, so no new visual screenshot claim is made for this final pass.

2026-08-18 — Qixi serial progressive delivery pipeline
- Corrected the split-generation handoff: Part 1a no longer remains hidden inside `prepareQixiMemoryBundle` until Part 1b/1c finish. Each accepted response is converted into a complete playable stage bundle and delivered to React before the next strictly serial request starts.
- Flappy becomes ready as soon as opening + rooms 01–02 pass the full parser. Rooms 03–05 replace their placeholders immediately when Part 1b returns, then Part 1c starts with the accepted middle-room seed. Rooms 06–07 + bridge arrive from Part 1c, which immediately starts the combined finale request.
- Added `materialPhaseReady` gating at room transitions. If the player reaches room 03 or room 06 before its real generated slice arrives, the transition waits there; it cannot enter or expose local placeholder room content. `render_game_to_text` now reports the ready phase and current-room readiness.
- Added behavioral parsing coverage for first- and second-stage playable bundles plus a source-order regression proving delivery 1 precedes request 2, delivery 2 precedes request 3, and delivery 3 follows request 3. Final focused verification passed 8 files / 68 tests. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client was attempted again but its installed script still cannot import Playwright, so no new screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi direct-LLM script pipeline
- Matched the earlier special-event generation style: retrieved memories are only prompt context, while each model response is the final playable dialogue/options/actions/transitions. Removed the semantic validator from the active and exported parser instead of judging whether generated prose contains planner-approved keywords.
- The parser now performs shape tolerance only: JSON fences, arrays represented as keyed objects, newline-delimited text, common field aliases, and missing technical IDs are normalized without changing visible model prose. It no longer filters choices by evidence IDs, keyword regexes, minimum prose length, or scene meaning, and it never replaces generated rooms with local copy.
- Progressive phase bundles contain empty, gated slots for future rooms rather than local fallback scenes. Generated room overlays, word-cloud traits, Char selections, transitions, wishes, mutters, quips, and bridge lines stay model-authored. A true unreadable response raises the existing visible regeneration error; fresh generation no longer silently falls back to cached/local story content.
- Updated visible/internal wording from “素材包” to “最终可播放剧本/完整剧情” where it described the generation result. The four requests remain strictly serial and the creative prompt rules remain intact.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (47 tests), including direct-prose preservation, three-choice preservation, loose object/array parsing, progressive no-fallback slots, bridge preservation, call ordering, SSE completion, BGM, chat card, launch popup, reunion, and session state. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. Full-repo TypeScript still reports pre-existing unrelated errors and no Qixi error. The required web-game client was attempted but its own environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no new automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi readable other-layer performance and exclusive BGM
- Made every player-visible prompt field address the User in second person (`你 / 你的`) directly in the generation contract, including options, results, Char actions, transitions, memory lines, and bridge copy. The runtime still preserves model prose and does not locally rewrite pronouns.
- Removed the two-line crop from the Char-action performance panel. The complete action now wraps naturally; its mobile type is a crisp 14px/500-weight system Chinese face with opaque color, no glow/filter blur, and a clearer 10px stage label. Other small Char-layer notes also have readable mobile sizing and no height clipping.
- Confirmed room 04 maps to the exploration group and room 05 maps to the other-side group. Added a module-wide single-owner audio lock so a newly mounted room immediately pauses, silences, and rewinds any outgoing Qixi track, including one owned by a briefly overlapping previous view. Pending play promises and fade timers also abort when they lose ownership.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (48 tests), including a direct room-04-to-room-05 audio ownership regression. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client was attempted again but its environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Room 04 Char private-item semantics
- Tightened the offerings contract: `charContribution` is now explicitly a concrete private possession belonging to Char and meaningful to Char personally. It may be unrelated to User or shared memories and must not default to a gift prepared for User.
- The model may expose, through a short in-character quip, why Char uses, keeps, carries, values, or is reluctant to part with the private item; the visible object itself remains concrete rather than an explanatory summary.
- Updated the second offering slot label to “另一边放下私物” so the visual order reads as User placing their own item followed by Char independently placing their own private item.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (48 tests), including prompt assertions for private meaning, no shared-memory requirement, and no forced gift framing. Vite transformed all 6,128 modules and emitted a refreshed production index. The required web-game client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` dependency.

2026-08-18 — Mobile-safe final hold gesture
- Hardened the final glowing-orb hold for phone browsers. The touch stage, touch surface, orb, and orb descendants now disable native panning/zoom capture, overscroll, text selection, iOS touch callouts, image/element dragging, and tap highlight without disabling page zoom globally.
- Pointer down accepts only the primary touch/left mouse button, prevents the compatibility gesture, and captures the pointer. Pointer up, `pointercancel`, and `lostpointercapture` all terminate the active hold safely; explicit context-menu and drag-start cancellation prevent native long-press UI from replacing the Qixi interaction.
- Added a source-wiring regression for the full mobile suppression/cancellation contract. All 10 Qixi test files passed (49 tests), and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot import its `playwright` dependency, so real-device visual automation remains unavailable in this environment.

2026-08-18 — Removed broken Qixi BGM variant
- Removed `bgm/qixi/03/02_0_月下双向.mp3` from the `otherSide` random pool. Rooms 05–07 can now select only `01_0_鹊桥月色.mp3` or `03_0_月下双向.mp3`; the broken variant is never assigned, requested, or played.
- Exported the track map for a direct regression assertion that both verifies the remaining pair and forbids the removed path. All 10 Qixi test files passed (50 tests), Vite transformed 6,128 modules and refreshed the production output. The required web-game client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v19 identity suspense, market agency, birds, and room transitions
- Kept Part 1 inside the shared mystery: Char is also trapped and forced through the seven strange interactions, cannot know the opposite operator is User, and may only call them `某人` / `另一边` / `那家伙` or voice a late suspicion. The first explicit identity confirmation now belongs to the Part 3 reunion, where Char can naturally reveal `我就知道对面是你` in their own voice.
- Reframed the memory market as two independent choices. User selects a concrete evidence-derived dream-market good; Char separately picks something that `某人` might like as a tentative probe, then secretly buys a distinct private item for themself. The generation contract explicitly rejects unsupported jealousy, rivalry, possessiveness, or forced User relevance.
- Replaced the abstract bridge marks with a recognizable inline bird SVG containing body, wing, tail, and eye, while retaining the two-color flight trails. Added seven scene-specific transition emblems—error wipe, wish card, needle/thread, offerings, water ripples, market stall, and grape-vine word cloud—so every room announces its place before the text resumes.
- Bumped the Part 1 cache/purpose to v19 so older identity-leaking scripts cannot be reused. All 10 Qixi test files passed (52 tests), and Vite completed its production transform of 6,128 modules. The required web-game Playwright client was attempted but its own environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no new automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Restored light magpies and enlarged Char-colour performance copy
- Reverted the bridge/reunion bird component from the heavy inline SVG silhouette to the earlier lightweight two-stroke CSS magpie glyph and removed the SVG-specific size/flap overrides.
- Promoted every Char-colour line inside the central room performance from decorative microcopy to readable dialogue. On phones, ordinary quip bubbles now extend beyond the small circular object, use 13–14px copy with larger padding, and retain full wrapping; lost-layer whispers, cleared-error instruction, real reply, wish whisper, offering aside, and the separate Char action beat were all enlarged together.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (53 tests), and the Vite production build completed successfully with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client was attempted again but remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`, so no screenshot-based visual claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Qixi room 07 empty word-cloud recovery
- Diagnosed the reported mobile freeze from the supplied screenshot: room 07 reached its idle `0 / 3` state, but `wordArtifacts` was empty because the runtime only accepted exact top-level artifact ids. Model-generated labels, inline word objects, third-phase ids that were absent from the first-phase artifact bank, and mis-typed trait artifacts were silently discarded, leaving no buttons to press.
- Added tolerant generated-word resolution across exact ids, labels, inline options, Char selection references, trait artifacts, and finally the already generated artifact bank. Char selections now resolve by either id or label. No visible generated word is replaced with local story prose.
- Made the interaction self-healing: fewer than three usable generated words lowers the target to the available count; zero usable words exposes a plain Continue route instead of a dead screen; old saves whose Char reveal counter is ahead of User selections accept the next tap and reconcile; a completed 3/3 save advances even if it resumes before the effect timer fired.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (56 tests), including exact reproductions for label/inline refs, missing ids, short lists, and stale reveal counters. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`; the supplied failure screenshot was inspected directly, but no post-fix automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Qixi Part 1 phase-envelope tolerance hotfix
- Diagnosed the widespread `Part 1 中三站结构无效 (finish_reason=stop)` dialog from the supplied mobile screenshot. The model had completed a multi-thousand-character response, but a residual exact-key gate rejected the whole response unless it used a `scenes` object containing the literal canonical keys `threadNeedle`, `offerings`, and `reflection`.
- Replaced that gate with shape-only phase extraction. Generated scenes now survive `data/result/output/partN` wrappers, `rooms/locations/stages/chapters` envelopes, arrays, direct top-level scene objects, numbered keys such as `scene_3`, common English aliases, and Chinese room titles. Unlabelled scene objects are assigned to the requested phase in response order; visible prose remains untouched and no local story copy is substituted.
- Applied the same normalization to all three Part 1 calls and added common embedded-bridge aliases (`bridgeData`, `userBirds`, `charNodes`, `finalBird`, etc.) so the format bug cannot simply move to the final phase. An error now remains only when the requested generated room bodies genuinely cannot be found at all.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (57 tests), including wrapped arrays, alias keys, Chinese titles, direct objects, and bridge aliases. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`; the supplied error screenshot was inspected directly, but no post-fix automated screenshot claim is made.
