2026-10-02 — Static photo pose picker
- User rejects Hug Me for photo use, wants individual static poses; explicitly asks connect source libraries to existing picker. Downloaded MakeHuman CC0 poses03 (36 standing) + poses01 (18 sitting):54 actual BVHs, native thumbnails/meta, hashed ZIPs and source-page snapshots in ignored output/social-motion-intake/poses. BOOTH Rieru13/GODPOSE6 five-pose free endpoints attempted, both redirect sign-in; not downloaded/countable, shown in pending list. No purchases.
- Added art/chibi/download-photo-poses.mjs (hash-verified restore + zip path containment) and catalog-photo-poses.mjs (offline source-license/track/finite validation; source frame0; Z-up conversion, MakeHuman onlyroot translation convention; source finger tips retained; 54 single-pose point caches). Native .thumb copied without edits, native BVH unchanged. Source anatomy preview only, not Chibi/body2 retarget; photo bodies/props in thumbnails not imported. Credits: art/chibi/motion-sources/PHOTO-POSE-CREDITS.md.
- Existing room3d-motion-library now has ?view=poses, separate pose/motion tabs,36/18 category filters, two-column thumbnail grid, per-card checkboxes, freeze-only viewer, front/side/back +prev/next, mobile card-to-viewer scroll. Shared existing favorites/export keeps39 approved motions; pose selection refreshes persistently.235 motion previews +54 poses =289 overall; no pose auto-approved. Mobile status explicitly states source skeleton, not final avatar.
- Validation: restore run verifies both hashes; catalog54 passed. .tmp/photo-pose-qa.mjs loadsall54, finite/frozen poses, all54 thumbnails, sitting/search/multi-select/reload/remove/export41 with39approved, pose/motion switch and views; no console/page errors,390px nooverflow. Fixed gallery compressed grid rows found by screenshot. Fixed test locator uncheck retry after its card vanishes by using exact checkbox click. .tmp/hug-library-qa.mjs regressionpassed, oldBVH/VRMA/Hug controls and39 unchanged. Vite build passed (existingchunkwarning). Skillclient final step/side/front screenshots and6 representative poses +desktop/mobile reviewed; expanded front/side/back camera depth margin after spotting clipped deep sitting pose. Screenshot .tmp/photo-pose-framing verifies corrected bounds. Production photo mode/multi-resident/real-body adaptation remains separate and not claimed complete. No commit/push/version bump.

2026-10-02 — Load AIRYAA Hug Me; defer paid candidates
- User asks load Hug Me first and stop considering paid for now. ZIP and original VMDs retained locally. Added paired 28.533s MMD reference preview to motion library, query motion=hug-me-airyaa and candidate load button; 235 total (234 source +1 reference), approved39 unchanged. Paid RBStudio/Reallusion candidates deferred/hidden, historical research retained.
- VMD has no Tda rig. Downloaded pinned Three r169 sample Miku PMD + source licenses to ignored couple-research/MMD-reference. art/chibi/preview-airyaa-hug.mjs hash-checks PMD and2VMDs, evaluates VMD Bézier position/rotation + CCD leg IK, inserts missing root/groove/upperBody2/IK-parent reference controls; writes ignored 30fps world-point cache. This is approximate reference anatomy, not original Tda, and not character retarget. Grip/spread/thumb0 and hair/face controls not represented; unhandled active tracks recorded. No source geometry/textures/physics/audio used or redistributed. Local readmes preserved; model not MIT.
- Preserve shared source coordinates, cut jumps/offstage root keys and full long-track endpoint; shorter actor holds final frame. Default12.933s paired shot; focus-current and full-capture fit. No automatic contact corrections or fabricated hug loop.
- .tmp/hug-library-qa.mjs passed pair/duration/finite poses at cuts/end, deterministic seek, half speed/play/pause/loop, immutable39approval/export, BVH/VRMA switching, candidate load and390px layout; no browser errors. Vite isolatedbuild passed existingchunkwarning. Skillclient .tmp/hug-me-skill run and screenshot inspected; pose0/14.2/26.2 plusmobile inspected. Remaining original Tda/grip fidelity and Chibi/body2 contact retargeting are explicitly not complete. No commit/push/versionbump.

2026-10-02 — User approves exported39; couple-motion research/download
- User provides C:/Users/tiaotiao/Downloads/sully-motion-selection.json and says these are good, find more couple actions. Validated all39 against catalog IDs and paths; includes prior3 plus36 new. Persisted art/chibi/motion-sources/social-approved-selection.json with export SHA256; all entries approved regardless of old false flags in export. Catalog rebuild reapplies approvals; filter/export now reflect39. Does not imply retargeted character acceptance.
- Found8 source groups in couple-candidates.json, shown in existing motion-library page with jump link. AIRYAA Hug Me ZIP actually downloaded from author video's MediaFire link (4,967,905 bytes, SHA256 cb628172c92c9a0dd7d1e755d4b98f94df6b73f06641d79dcf4297695b7d21a3); 2 main VMD tracks28.2/28.53s plus extra reaction25.7s parsed/finite checked. Readme requires author credit/video link, prohibits redistribution, permits fitting motion to model. Local ignored storage only; no VMD playback/retarget claimed. Original ZIP preserved, only3VMD +readme extracted, no files executed.
- New concrete complete paired paid candidates RBStudio Romantic1 (FBX;2/3 onlyUE confirmed) and Reallusion Motions for Lovers (iClone8 export pipeline). MoCap Central free sample explicitly lists paired proposalSuccess A/B; store claim still needed, not downloaded. Three new BOOTH free packs (A-sh4514593/SOShop4658134/hez4964592) actual downloads redirect login; LittleKiss author's Patreon403; CxtBoyoDA403. UC-3D only captures one person's MVN so cannot serve full paired hug. No purchases/auth bypass/userdata submissions.
- Validation: .tmp/couple-library-qa.mjs checks39approved, handholding search, disabled removal,39exportflags,8candidates,localZIP and390px nooverflow, no browsererrors. Fixed test harness relative request URL (not app defect), rerun passed. Independent Vitebuild passed (chunk warning). Skill .tmp/couple-selection-skill shot/state inspected; desktop/mobile candidate screenshots inspected. Source count remains234 playable, not adding raw VMD as playable.
- Remaining: user considers new candidates; source01/02/03 and all39 approved still need actual character retargeting; HugMe may be a comedic story and is not yet verified as calm looping hug. Keep rejected proceduralhug removed. Productionmultiresident integration not done. No commit/push/versionbump.

2026-10-02 — Full-body emote download and local audition library
- Latest user clarification: “表情” means full-body emotes/motions, not facial expressions. User went to rest and authorized autonomous completion. Download accessible files locally before selection; do not use redistribution uncertainty to block private audition. No purchases or login/CAPTCHA bypass.
- Downloaded 180 VRMA (Hanami 166, VoxAvatar 13, pixiv official test 1), 106 CMU BVHs (53 paired takes, subjects 18–23), 4 ReForge Unity body .anim, with source/license records. 313 files / 96,659,974 bytes in ignored output/social-motion-intake. Prior face-only intake separately kept, not counted and no longer expanded. All 180 VRMA hashes differ; many are variants or transition phases, not 180 distinct actions.
- Seven actual BOOTH free downloads return login HTML: pH + Scrap headpat, Andall 1/2/3, full Sachi + rerofumi. Hug Emote needs CAPTCHA. Recorded exact endpoints/status locally; no bogus ZIPs. CUA bootstrap failed with kernel assets/path-not-found; no browser cookies or auth bypass. Public download scripts used approved network escalation successfully.
- Added frozen source manifest, art/chibi/download-social-intake.mjs (hash checked, resumable) and catalog-social-intake.mjs (offline GLTF/BVH/keyframe validation and catalog). Re-ran restore: all313 hash-valid existing, zero failures. Rebuilt catalog: 286 animation files valid, zero invalid. CMU source license copied with local files.
- New test/fixtures/room3d-motion-library.html/.ts/.css: 234 playable entries including existing approved boxing; original humanoid bones, original root motion, one common pair display transform; no character retarget. Filters, search, playback/speed/pause/seek/loop/fit, localStorage favorites and export. Approved01/02/03 immutable source choices. Linked from original source review. README.txt and pending list in intake directory; browser open queued via Codex panel tool.
- Validation: .tmp/motion-library-qa.mjs loaded all234 and sampled10/50/90%, finite bones/expected actors; playback, endpoint, loop, search13Vox, favorites after reload, export, empty results,3approved, rapid load race,390px no overflow; no console/page errors. Isolated Vite build passed (large chunk warning). .tmp/game-client.mjs ran with existing source-review actions; shot/state in .tmp/motion-library-skill. Visually reviewed desktop, mobile, cheer, highfive and skill screenshots.
- Remaining outside this download/selection delivery: retarget already-selected01/02/03 to both body types; obtain actual hug/headpat/face-touch clips; production multi-resident integration. Do not revive rejected procedural hug. No commit/push, no version bump, no user save edits.

2026-10-02 — User accepts original clips 01/02/03; VRM search
- User explicitly approves source-review 01 single shoulder, 02 both shoulders, 03 solo boxing. Treat these as selected sources; no need to re-ask selection. Retargeting to both body types remains pending.
- Researched VRM/VRMA/VRChat primary sources: Sachi CC0 and rerofumi CC0 already used by this project; rerofumi includes single-person encouragement but no confirmed paired contact. Hanami/Overte remain useful general-motion sources. YUI head_pat is an idle-based receiving reaction, not giving a headpat. Rexclaw documents paired playback/offsets, not proof of bundled reusable hug tracks.
- New targeted candidates: free Andall Pairs Animation 1/2/3 Unitypackages (modification allowed, redistribution including modifications prohibited); VRCMods THEDAO77 Hug Emote (paired tracks and redistribution unverified); RamsterZ Couples Anim Pack (86 clips, raw FBX, US$21.99 on author site, explicit paired hugs on Fab). Author EULA additionally prohibits AI-specific projects and standalone asset redistribution, so do not purchase/import assuming ordinary game licence is sufficient; same caution for prior RamsterZ combat candidate.
- Updated SOCIAL-CREDITS.md and room3d.md with acceptance, concrete links and precise gaps. No new files downloaded, purchases, external messages, animation edits or tests needed for this research-only change. Remaining priority: adapt accepted CMU sources; obtain genuinely usable paired hug/headpat/face-touch sources. Current approved-source preview remains unchanged.

2026-10-02 — Withdraw rejected contact drafts; actual source review
- Latest user request: stop tangled/off-axis hugging; find existing assets and add boxing, face touch and shoulder pat. The previously reported hug fix below was rejected by the user. Removed procedural hug/headpat branches and buttons; retained greet, CMU handshake and talk. No new retargeted interaction is claimed complete.
- Downloaded pinned CMU/cgspeed BVHs: paired 22_07/23_07 single-hand shoulder comfort, 22_05/23_05 both-hands shoulder comfort, solo 13_17 boxing. Original files, SHA256/URLs/version manifest and source licence stored in public/room3d/motions/social-source/. No source edits; preview only skips calibration frame and applies one common scale/translation to all actors. Shoulder support is not automatically repeated patting, and solo boxing is not paired combat.
- Added room3d-social-sources.html with geometric original-skeleton playback, pause/restart/half speed/scrub/OrbitControls, preserving paired root motion and placement. Existing social page links to it. Fixed mobile grid intrinsic canvas overflow caught by browser QA.
- Source research in SOCIAL-CREDITS.md and preview sidebar: Reallusion Meeting lists Handshake & Hug; WondAR greeting/hug is 9 sec but paired A/B not confirmed; pH MotionWorks headpat offers height variants but forbids redistribution; RamsterZ has authored paired counters/block/parry/slip (not acquired, not mocap). No suitable face-touch file confirmed. MocapOnline cuddle article is a request/concept, not an available pack; MoCapCentral catalogue not confirmed for these requested actions. External product descriptions checked, videos/files not visually approved. No paid purchases or restricted assets imported.
- Validation: 3 social tests pass; isolated Vite build of both fixtures passes (existing large-chunk warning). Browser .tmp/source-review-qa.mjs checks all 3 sources, playback/pause/restart/end/scrub/speed, rapid switching, mobile width, existing handshake and links, no page/console errors. Reviewed shoulder/shoulders/boxing/mobile and retained-handshake screenshots. Skill client .tmp/source-review-final-skill run and reviewed. Initial mobile failure fixed; pnpm vitest shim missing so used pnpm exec node with installed Vitest entry, and actions JSON moved to a file to avoid Windows quoting failure.
- Remaining: user source review; obtain suitable distributable paired hug/headpat/face-touch/combat files; retarget reviewed sources to same-height body2 then height variants and classic. Do not revive the rejected procedural hug. Production Home3D multiple residents, collision/approach and user appearance remain unimplemented. No commit/push or user save changes.

2026-10-02 — Hug handedness and arm-route correction (superseded by user rejection)
- User rejected the hug as tangled. Found responder hands used initiator's world lateral signs despite facing 180 degrees away; back-of-hand normals were inverted too. Corrected per-participant handedness and palm orientation. Replaced hug-only unconstrained CCD with two-bone solve and outward elbow poles; retain bend when target is unreachable rather than locking straight. Other interactions keep their solver.
- Asymmetric near-back/far-upper-arm targets, smaller embrace offset, outward chest lean and head turn. Open arms before closing distance; separate before lowering arms, including cancel. This remains a contact study, not a newly sourced/approved motion. Extreme-height hugs still need authored posture variants; capped reach does not prove exact contact with every garment.
- Four social tests pass, including same/extreme heights, two world headings, elbow-side invariants and release/cancel separation; prior furniture six tests passed before the final hug-only bend cap. Browser captured default/extreme/swapped/classic from both sides and checked stop/no errors. Inspected .tmp/hug-fixed-*.png; isolated production build passed. No commit/push.

2026-10-02 — Multi-resident social audition (not production integration)
- User: home includes user and additional characters; one body type per scene; greet/headpat/handshake/hug/talk, preserve body-2 height differences and prefer existing clips. Optional scope question was unanswered; proceeded with the stated independent audition default. A second pending question asks whether headpat/hug should wait for suitable existing assets (paid candidates acceptable) or may be hand adapted. Do not interpret silence as asset approval.
- Added room3d-social fixture with three residents, selectable pair, role swap, uniform body mode, per-resident body-2 height, pause/seek/replay/stop and deterministic browser hooks. Added ID-based paired runtime, visitors.finishPose for clothing after paired solves. Production editor/Home3DView still single resident; no user appearance/database writes added.
- CMU 18_01/19_01 acquired from pinned cgspeed mirror, retargeted at 30 Hz using added T-pose calibration. Hash-checked importer, source/terms copy and SOCIAL-CREDITS.md record included. Greet reuses selected Meshy; conversation reuses selected CC0 Mesh2Motion. No paid/restricted asset imported. Headpat/hug are labelled procedural CONTACT STUDIES, NOT selected source animations or visually approved work. Headpat head collision/hand visibility and hug height variants still require work; do not report all five finished.
- Numeric QA caught unreachable handshake for .8/1.25 heights when using shorter shoulder; fixed shared target from BOTH shoulders. Classic spacing cannot scale by torso height because head remains large. 9 tests (social + prior furniture motion) passed; checks include extreme heights, roles, thumb-up contacts, fixed bone lengths, observer state, busy reservation, natural finish/cancel/reset and mixed-body rejection.
- Browser lifecycle checked selected source actions at extreme heights, role swap, third participant, stop/finish, all five classic buttons and mobile/no horizontal overflow; no page errors. Inspected screenshots including side/reverse views, .tmp/social-extreme-*, social-classic-*, social-mobile.png, skill loop output. Fixture production build passed with existing large bundle warning. Full project tsc has existing errors (including vite proxy configuration); no errors matching new social files or visitor in output .tmp/social-tsc.txt. No commit/push.
- Remaining: select/obtain suitable headpat/hug sources or user permission to hand author them; replace contact studies and visually validate equal/tall/short pairs and different hairstyles. Then implement real home multi-resident appearance ownership, placement/obstacle navigation and interaction UI. One concurrent pair is an audition limitation; future multiple pairs require per-session ownership.

2026-09-29 — Bed entry contact correction
- User identified sitting in midair before lying down. Confirmed the old simultaneous floor-to-sleep root interpolation bent the legs outside the bed. Added approved-walk approach with a reachable bedside endpoint, followed by separate turn, edge contact, dangling legs, lift, inboard transfer and recline phases (4.8s; reverse for rise).
- Visual QA caught a second error: catalog half-width includes the draped blanket; its outer edge is not a sitting surface. Measured shipped GLB by raycast and calibrated show_bed edge x=±1.30, y=.85. Excluded rounded foot-end entry. Root height compensates the pelvis pivot throughout contact; no skeleton rescale or new motion assets.
- 19 targeted motion/seating tests passed, including actual GLB contact rays, both sides/four furniture rotations, ordered leg lift/recline, fixed bone lengths and pose reset. Comparison fixture production build passed. Browser left/right selections, walk-to-bed, edge sit, leg lift, recline, rise, interrupted rise/resize and actor reuse passed without page errors; right selection can approach from the reachable opposite side. Inspected .tmp/bed-contact-*.png and bed-contact-skill/shot-0.png; skill Playwright loop passed.
- This fixes bed entry placement, not a new approved sleep animation. Existing final sleep style remains a placeholder awaiting user review. Only reviewed show_bed body-2 profile uses this path; classic/other beds unchanged. No commit/push.

2026-09-17 — Finished showrooms, windows/doors and source fidelity
- Added five wall-snapping daylight windows, three animated panel/lattice door styles, independent wall/tabletop decor and two geometry rugs. Five presets are furnished, 9–14 items, and styles can be applied without replacing furniture.
- User corrected over-simplification: coarse splitting must preserve original shapes. Kept original flower/cat cushion geometry; restored wood cabinet tones, actual extracted curtain folds, wall frame depth, rugs and equipment. No source image/UV/color baking. Original image-painted patterns are intentionally not reproduced.
- Separate left/right cushion colors persist/copy/undo/redo; material names validated against catalog. Shared normals across color seams. Fixed floor polygon offset hiding thin rugs and duplicate color-change events adding empty undo steps.
- 18 room3d test files / 117 tests pass. Browser checks cover styles, cushion colors, grouped decor storage, reload and lie-down, plus all five presets. Isolated experimental Vite build passes (existing bundle-size warning). No commit/push and unrelated chat/memory edits untouched.

2026-09-16 — Rear hair 1 outer wrap + tucked wisp liner
- Wrapped back1 now adds one derived inner silhouette layer, in the same hair pivot with shared width/length/position controls and solid back1 color. Main scalp wrap and back2's original artwork remain intact. Explicit projected back1 and full extra wraps do not get duplicate liners.
- User corrected upper cropping: removed the height clamp that erased crown wisps; only sink the cap root, preserving height differences and original upper wisps. Lower side locks retain source-canvas registration. Face and outer wrap naturally occlude the inner layer.
- User requested slight padding: liner now has a shallow .022-per-side curved shell with a closed rounded rim. Simplified contours within half a source pixel and used coarser internal tessellation; comparison scene dropped from 191,936 to 171,402 triangles with visually unchanged wisps. No frame-time geometry work.
- Eleven hair geometry/classification/seam tests passed; game-client front/side/rear checks covered wispy back1_04 and plain back1_01, restored ahoge, and final shallow volume. Screenshots inspected under output/hair-liner, final run had no browser errors. Isolated chibi build passed with existing chunk-size advisory.

2026-09-16 — Solid rear-hair color trial
- User correction: ONLY back1 is solid-colored. Back2 and extra layers sourced from back2 retain original artwork. Verified back1-only rear comparison through game client; screenshot inspected, no browser errors.
- Back1/back2 (including extra layers sourced from them) now take a single opaque-pixel average color from their own tinted source. Curved projected faces and rims use solid materials; wrapped rear hair keeps source alpha with flattened RGB. Rear scalp gap/crown color follows the solid back1 shade. Front/ear hair artwork and all geometry/placement settings are preserved.
- Compared before/after rear view through the game client, screenshot inspected at output/hair-solid/rear/shot-0.png; no browser errors. Isolated chibi build passed with existing bundle-size advisory. Source PNGs and creator's 2D rendering remain unchanged.

2026-09-16 — Paired curved hair sheets
- User clarified the replacement should be spherical/curved like scalp hair, not flat extruded plates. Projected hair now traces subpixel contours (including disconnected islands and holes), tessellates matching front/rear source-UV surfaces, and maps them onto continuous elliptical cross-sections following each tuft. A texture-free, matching-color rounded rim closes the pair. Ordinary wrap mode remains unchanged. Empty transparent layers are skipped.
- Existing puff save key retained, now shown as 发片厚度. Cached contour work runs only at model creation; no frame-time contour generation. Geometry resources follow existing disposal. Original layer width/length/offset settings still apply.
- Nine geometry/classification/seam tests passed: curved rather than flat caps, mirrored fronts/backs with identical source UV mapping, separate plain rim, islands/holes, empty/zero-depth geometry. Compared buns and long ponytail from front/side/rear using game client; screenshots under output/hair-shell/sections, side-buns, rear-tail inspected. Build passed with existing bundle-size warning. Intermediate flat-shell approach superseded.

2026-09-15 — Smooth padded hair
- Replaced raw sqrt(distance) puff with a symmetric eight-neighbor distance field, cached separable smoothing, rounded crest and eased thin edge. Projected sheets use 96×120 subdivisions; wrapped scalp sheets remain 64×80. Source UVs, colors, length and placement are unchanged. No per-frame smoothing work.
- Eight chibi hair/padding/seam tests passed, including mirrored round tufts and smooth crown, disconnected tufts and transparent holes. Compared original/current real-body buns and long ponytail via game client; screenshots inspected under output/puff/final-buns and final-tail, no browser errors. Isolated chibi build passed with existing bundle-size advisory.

2026-09-15 — Deferred furniture rotation validation
- Rotation now stages an unsaved visual preview, including supported tabletop props. Overlap and floor bounds do not block turning; pointer release or 放下 validates and commits once. Invalid drops retain preview; cancel/Escape restores valid layout. Undo cancels pending preview; successful placement uses normal undo/redo. Furniture dragging defers collision messages until release.
- Passed 35 focused model tests, rotation browser QA (bounds and furniture collision, real drag to valid placement, prop transform, undo/redo, cancel/Escape), and media regression QA. Inspected preview/drop/placement and game-client screenshots. Isolated chibi production build passed with existing large-chunk advisory. Original creator tab left unchanged.

2026-09-15 — Plant category and nearest-wall windows
- Added shared isWaterablePlant contract: floor surface AND waterable === true. Both the 绿植 category and watering action list use it; tabletop/decorative plants do not qualify. Persisted this rule in furniture asset docs.
- Unified wooden windows into one canonical GLB/catalog item with surface wall. Old left-window instances migrate without losing identity/color/orientation. wallMount.js finds real shell/high-wall faces, merges adjacent coplanar high walls, clamps the full window to wall bounds and faces it inward. Pointer dragging intersects candidate wall planes and switches walls in the same gesture. Empty edges, low walls, fences and undersized faces are excluded.
- Wall removal/movement stores windows that lose their mounting face in the same undo transaction. Reused regular placement, storage, recolor, copy and save logic. Removed duplicate left-window output and updated generator/fixtures/media QA to use canonical assets.
- Passed 35 unit tests (including old-save migration, NaN rejection, corner/height bounds, high-wall faces, adjacency, collisions and category constraints), real pointer drag back→left→back, undo/redo, recolor, storage/reload and host-wall removal/undo browser QA. Media QA passed. Inspected left/back wall screenshots; artifacts under output/wall-mount.

2026-09-15 — Wooden window / split television / new console
- Imported geometry-only window (4,170 source triangles) and gaming nook (1,824 source triangles). Added reproducible media-assets.mjs and clean sources, no imported images/UVs or sampled colors. Retained project woodLight. Window has back/left variants with opaque pale-blue panes; television and closed-top cabinet are separate assets, removed original console/controller and shelf clutter.
- Built original rounded cream console and a separate controller with sticks, d-pad and four colored buttons. Added all parts to existing furniture categories; cabinet provides conservative support and prop transforms follow it. Catalog paintMaterials limits repainting to the intended surfaces while preserving wood/screen/buttons.
- Media asset/browser QA passed budgets, no images/UVs, wood, category, valid supports, rotate/follow, recolor, independent storage, undo/redo and serializable state. Inspected gallery and in-room screenshots under output/botanical/media-gallery.png and output/media/room.png. User's original creator tab was left in place; no navigation to a test-only page.
- Final verification: 16 room/watering tests passed, game-client screenshot inspected with no console error artifact, isolated experiment build passed (existing bundle-size advisory only). New assets available in original room furniture catalog; no remaining required work.

2026-09-15 — Restore navigation to the character creator
- The user was in the isolated botanical QA fixture, which never included the full creator. Confirmed /chibi-experiment.html still has the existing material picker and 3D adjustment UI; added a visible return-to-home / creator link to the botanical fixture.
- Used the actual in-app tab to follow that link and open 捏小人. Verified material categories, undo/redo controls, 选素材, 3D 调整 and 捏好了，去小屋 in the live UI. Left the user in the original creator without changing appearance controls.

2026-09-15 — Repair table leg joints
- User spotted eaten-away joints: the original triangle-centroid cut left jagged open rims, and smoothing / restoring only global bounds did not reconnect each individual leg. Raised every rim into the tabletop and capped all five legs; kept foot positions, table dimensions and support height.
- Added regression assertions for closed manifold leg edges and >0.05 overlap into the slab for all five legs. Passed geometry checks; front/back low-angle captures in output/botanical/joints-*.png. Asset now 5,144 triangles / 105,172 bytes.

2026-09-15 — Smoother daisy table
- Smoothed noisy radial samples before closed-spline interpolation; widened the tabletop round-over with four bevel segments and continuous normals. Relaxed wood-leg geometry using alternating Taubin passes without subdivision. Preserved the approved furniture footprint and support height for existing placements.
- Regenerated daisy_table.glb: 4,996 triangles / 104,184 bytes, no image textures. Inspected the close-up screenshot (output/botanical/table-smooth.png); asset budget check passed. Game-client cold-load click timed out, reran with a load pause and no early click.

2026-09-15 — GLB plant / clear daisy table and watering
- Imported supplied Meshy table (323,002 triangles / 15 MB) and monstera (2,186 triangles / 4.52 MB), stripping images and UVs before processing. Added reproducible geometry-only sources and botanical-assets.mjs; no source-image color sampling. Six delivered assets total 320,924 bytes; table 3,236 triangles, plant 2,282 triangles. Shared solid materials, project woodLight, smooth table rim.
- Cleared and closed the flower tabletop, split vase, books, cup, cookie plate into separate tabletop furniture. Rebuilt closed books because source fused their hidden faces with the cup. Conservative circular support; accessories follow table move/rotate/store through existing support logic.
- Added waterable catalog metadata and four-sided wateringSpot with whole-head/body and room-edge clearance. Manual chibi watering uses rigid hands, a shared geometric can and seven droplets; ends after 4.4 seconds, cancels when plant disappears / room changes / another action begins, revalidates when furniture moves. No autonomous pathfinding or multi-resident occupancy yet. Reduced-motion shows a static pose.
- Added furniture import protocol and AGENTS navigation so future GLBs follow texture removal, manual color, geometry budget and interaction validation.
- Passed 27 room/building/seating/watering unit tests, botanical asset/browser QA (image/UV-free, supports, gesture lifecycle, storage cancellation, no repeated GPU growth), full seating browser regression, game-client loop and isolated experiment production build. Visually inspected room / watering / game-client screenshots; only existing bundle-size advisory. Preview: /test/fixtures/room3d-botanical.html. Artifacts: output/botanical. No remaining required work for this request.

2026-09-13 — Modular 3D home
- Added selection-only soft inverted-hull outlines using shared geometry, procedural movement grid and green/red occupancy footprint. Invalid drops revert; guide lifetime and eight repeated selections verified without GPU resource growth. Interaction regression and visual guide checks passed; no full-screen postprocessing or idle animation added.
- Reworked editing into click-to-select / drag-selected, blank-space orbit and always-available wheel/pinch/button zoom. Replaced giant selection sheet/3D bounds with a compact toolbar and footprint; added redo and shortcuts. Camera no longer resets after edits, inertia disabled. Browser interaction QA passed including real CDP touch pinch, non-mutating selection, undo/redo and camera preservation; 10 model tests passed.
- Added whole-shell themes and separate floor/trim colors, camera rotation controls during editing, and persisted device-local eco/balanced/clear resolution presets. Eco defaults to no animation/shadows and stops RAF entirely at idle. Browser quality checks verified rotation leaves furniture unchanged, actual pixel ratios, persistence, and idle frame counts; existing editing and model tests passed.
- Added furniture categories and tabletop support: split tea-table props into independent assets, added a bare desk, shape/height-aware snapping, bounds/collision checks, parent movement/rotation, group storage/transfer, and legacy layout migration. Ten model tests plus support browser flow passed; no continuous physics added.
- Current request: turn the Blender jellyfish room into editable asset furniture, recoloring and storage, with rooms expanding across a floor and stacking into multiple floors. Keep 2D homes available.
- Implemented a shared WebGL editor, per-character home3D state, Blender asset-kit extraction, and isolated preview. Reworked initial spacing and removed staircase/entry clutter.
- Seven model tests and browser editing/persistence checks passed. Real OSProvider/RoomApp/IndexedDB fixture verified optional 2D/3D switching and unchanged original roomConfig. 24-room stress test verified stable geometry/material/texture counts after eight round trips and no idle redraws. Touch detail budget 2 rooms, desktop 4; cached single-room shadows, overview shadows off, shared materials, lifecycle cleanup, hidden-page pause. See docs/room3d.md. Actual phone performance remains unmeasured; repository-wide tsc has pre-existing errors outside changed files.

2026-09-12 — SAR NPC opt-out covers dependent features
- Explicit hide now suppresses room titles, warehouse title editor/keepsakes, collection roster/exclusive tabs and NPC-only egg/chimera entries. Existing unlocks, titles, coins, inventory and chat history are retained for re-enable. Active roster exits immediately, including cross-tab changes; rewind entry is hidden while off.
- Added shared sarNpcPreference leaf gate and same-page setting event. Normal chat omits NPC public background/title injection; activity title instructions and in-flight title application are gated. Personal-line offers/advancement and undelivered Easter-egg messages pause while disabled.
- Fishing and garden use neutral facility wording when off; fish sales still settle at market prices without Aiven dialogue/art. Help text follows the same setting. General chips/modules/fish/dinosaurs remain available.
- New preference unit tests and isolated browser script scripts/test-sar-npc-off.mjs cover opt-out prompts, unchanged collection data, recovery receipts, cross-tab UI transitions and restored progress. Browser run passed; screenshots of off collection, warehouse and official skill room inspected under output/sar-npc-off. No real user storage modified, no commit or push.

2026-09-12 — SAR economy second calibration
- Paid permanent-chip draws now cost 90 (was 30); UI explanatory text uses the same constant. Kept two free draws/day, 120 starting wallets, 180 personal buyback and 18–34 consumable module prices. No extra fishing delay or existing-asset clawback.
- Each pool separately persists a duplicate streak: after two owned draws, the next chooses uniformly among unowned chips, resetting on a new chip. Free and paid both count; complete pools remain drawable. Legacy saves start the counter at zero. The counter commits atomically with wallet/inventory/receipt and survives backup/restore.
- Free claims now require a later local date, preventing backward-clock replenishment. Old 30-coin quotes reject rather than charging 90 silently; receipt retries remain idempotent.
- 63 tests passed across gacha, commerce, economy, backup, collection, discounts and facility guides. Fixed a date-dependent existing concurrency test by freezing Date.now to its fixture date. Real browser commerce checks passed for 90-coin costs, double clicks, reload, install, zero-balance free draw, cross-tab spending and failed writes. Official skill client ran; inspected its guide screenshot and the paid-draw screenshot. Artifacts: output/sar-economy-audit and output/fishing-qa/sar-commerce.
- Updated economy/user docs and VRWorld README. Remaining design consideration: more character IDs still expand total startup funds and personal daily buyback supply; independent-wallet rules were not redesigned in this calibration. No changes to other pending personal-line/UI work; no commit or push in this turn.

2026-09-10 — SAR bulletin-board gameplay audit
- Current request: inspect the remaining SAR bulletin-board gameplay. Baseline: 60 fishing/market/session/real-DB tests pass.
- Reproduced by inspection: anonymous owners lose their alias when replying; item requests automatically surrender the first matching specimen; model listings omit whether goods are real or textual. Adding focused regressions and explicit specimen selection, with archive details retained.
- Existing pnpm launcher tries to reinstall dependencies and then cannot resolve the test binary with verification disabled; direct Node execution of the already-installed Vitest works without changing dependencies.
- Browser checks use isolated fixtures and mocked data, with no real model calls or user storage.
- Completed: owner replies inherit the post alias; item fulfillment accepts an exact catch ID and rejects missing/stale/ambiguous selections; model and UI expose real/text goods plus specimen size, quality and nickname. New listings and fulfilled requests retain specimen snapshots; detail sheets show transaction counterparties. Legacy archives remain readable without invented specimen history.
- Validation: all 162 tests in the VR-related run pass (14 suites), including five new market regressions. Dedicated market browser checks cover purchase, tips, favor fulfillment, chosen/stale specimens, anonymous replies, expiry, archive and reload at 390/320 px. Real OS/SAR entry/water/board round trips pass after repairing the old room-image test selector. Official game client state/screenshot and stable mobile detail screenshots inspected; no UI errors in the isolated checks.
- Vite production build passes (6,227 modules, 48.66 s) into ignored output/fishing-qa/market-build. Full TypeScript check still reports errors in other files; no diagnostics in the changed feature files. Existing chunk-cycle/pdf.js build warnings remain.
- Boundaries retained: request prices are not escrowed; market DM share remains inside the activity card. Real LLM behavior was not evaluated. Changes are local and uncommitted; no push/deployment. No remaining blockers for this audit.

2026-03-19
- Removed the hardcoded building PNG override in `utils/tinyTownTiles.ts` so LifeSim now uses generated pixel-style town tiles instead of `pics` house textures.
- Added story attachment types, world-drama prompt helpers, fallback attachment generation, and `materializeStoryAttachments` so main-plot events can drop image/item/evidence/fanfic payloads.
- Added `apps/lifesim/StoryAttachments.tsx` for compact attachment cards plus a modal detail viewer.
- Wired `apps/LifeSimApp.tsx` so `吃瓜` now randomly branches into either normal char-driven drama or a no-char main-plot event from `主线编剧室`.
- Seeded replay actions correctly for the new branch and moved `runCharTurns` above the user action handlers to avoid referencing it before initialization.
- Added a no-API fallback for char turns so the sim no longer gets stuck when external model settings are empty; chars will still produce lightweight “围观” replay entries.
- Updated the drama feed and replay overlay to surface main-plot badges, headlines, and attachment shelves.
- `npm run build` passes after the LifeSim changes.
- Automated Playwright validation is currently blocked because `C:\Users\tiaotiao\.codex\skills\develop-web-game\scripts\web_game_playwright_client.js` cannot resolve the `playwright` package in this environment.
- Added drama filters (`全部 / 角色 / 主线 / 系统`) and changed the normal drama log to keep the full scrollable history instead of truncating to 50.
- Added a LifeSim settings panel for selecting which external characters are allowed to participate in the sim.
- Added long-press NPC editing so residents can be edited in-place for this run (name / gender / personality / bio / backstory).
- Replaced the browser-native reset confirm with a custom retro dialog that can either reset directly or generate a LifeSim ending summary card before resetting.
- Added a new `lifesim_reset_card` score-card payload and wired it through chat rendering plus readable archive/context formatting in Chat / Character / chat prompt history.
- Text attachments like fanfic/evidence now surface the original text as the primary reading area in the attachment modal.
- Adjusted `apps/lifesim/DramaFeed.tsx` so main-plot actions also remain visible in the left-hand dynamic stream under `全部 / 主线`, instead of being excluded from `drama.log`.
- Restyled the LifeSim reset summary card in `components/chat/MessageItem.tsx` to look more like the game's retro pseudo-window UI (sharper borders, title bar, grid texture, status bar).
- `npm run build` still passes after the latest DramaFeed + chat-card styling changes.
- Automated browser validation is still blocked locally because `require('playwright')` fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

2026-08-17 — Qixi visual retheme
- Current request: rebuild the Qixi entry screen to match the supplied celestial poster reference, then retheme the in-game surfaces using the supplied deep-purple / lavender / blush-gold fantasy palette.
- Constraints: preserve the existing Qixi memory-generation and smart-context behavior; visual/layout changes only unless a UI integration fix is required.
- Visual thesis: a full-screen storybook night poster with deep plum space, lavender mist, cream moonlight, and restrained blush-gold ornament.
- Planned validation: Qixi entry at mobile and desktop sizes, then fake chat and first interlayer screens; inspect screenshots, render_game_to_text, and console errors.

- Removed LifeSim's autonomous NPC interaction step from the main turn flow, so only user-triggered actions and char/main-plot API turns advance the story now.
- Added LifeSim-specific independent API settings with global preset loading and a Gemini Flash recommendation, and persisted them on the LifeSim state so city resets do not wipe the app-specific config.
- Reworked `apps/lifesim/DramaFeed.tsx` again so `主线历史` appears above the current main-plot detail view, while keeping the archive separate from the general drama stream.
- Tightened LifeSim scroll behavior across the main panel, settings panel, action panel, and attachment viewer by hiding scrollbars and blocking horizontal overflow except for the attachment strip itself.
- `npm run build` passes after the latest LifeSim logic + layout + settings changes.

TODO
- If local browser testing is possible, verify both `吃瓜 -> 角色剧情` and `吃瓜 -> 主线剧情` paths and inspect attachment modal behavior.
- Install or provide `playwright` if automated screenshot-based UI validation is needed later.

2026-09-06 — 彼方钓鱼与本地市场板（进行中）
- Current request: implement the fishing system and bulletin-board market together inside the SAR activity space.
- Settled scope: each user's world owns its own market simulation; user and every character have separate persistent money, inventory, listings, requests, comments, and transaction history. Random passersby are local simulated actors. No market post/comment data is uploaded to Cloudflare.
- Weather boundary: fishing uses the existing real-perception weather when enabled and available; otherwise it uses a stable locally simulated daily weather, visibly labeled in the fishing UI.
- Gameplay boundary: user fishing is an original tide/resonance catch game inspired only by the abstract keep-in-zone mechanic; character fishing rolls the canonical catch in code, then uses one LLM call for reaction and post-catch choice.
- Signal-poetry boundary: the event is already ended; preserve the existing memorial output but later hard-freeze all write paths rather than relying only on the front-end ended flag.
- Validation plan: focused state tests, production build, then the required web-game Playwright client with deterministic `render_game_to_text` / `advanceTime`; if its known missing Playwright dependency still blocks it, document and use the available browser/UI fallback.
- First implementation slice landed: `vr_fishing_market_v1` owns per-actor wallets, catches, discovery, world-seeded daily prices, listings, requests, comments and a bounded ledger; it is included in SAR local backup and never leaves the device.
- Added an original circular-sonar “潮汐共振” canvas game with pointer/Space input, deterministic automation hooks and visible real-vs-simulated weather provenance. The catalog includes ordinary fish plus the 12 Aiven dinosaur/time-layer relics.
- Enabled the SAR `水域与布告板` facility. Moved the ended Signal Fall entry off page one and into a small read-only card on the new page-three `往期活动` archive.

2026-08-31 — 彼方 SAR 活动室开场（进行中）
- Current request: add the one-time `更新 · 彼方活动室` notice, let users explicitly show or hide the fixed NPCs Caian/Aiven, focus the second room page when welcomed, and implement the supplied first-meeting branching dialogue before building the three facilities.
- Visual thesis: a restrained dark-violet in-world update event, followed by a sparse galgame dialogue surface; placeholder NPC silhouettes are deliberately isolated so later expression/portrait assets can replace them without rewriting the dialogue state machine.
- Interaction thesis: two-step update consent, one-line-at-a-time dialogue, and a softly bouncing quest mark; unfinished dialogue remains replayable and only the final line clears the quest state.
- Added a versioned local SAR state model and the complete supplied dialogue graph as fixed front-end data. NPC visibility and `Caian met` are persisted separately.
- Added the SAR room to page two, a no-art placeholder scene, an NPC visibility control under `接入`, and front-end-only NPC rendering that does not enter prompts, dynamic cards, or memories.

TODO — SAR opening
- Completed the welcome path at 390×844: update notice → NPC choice → automatic page-two focus → SAR room → Caian quest mark → one-line dialogue → choices.
- Verified that closing dialogue mid-way preserves the quest mark, completing the short branch clears it, hiding NPCs leaves the room usable, and re-enabling returns to page two without replaying the completed introduction.
- Inspected update, preference, page-two, dialogue, and room screenshots. Removed duplicated placeholder wall/NPC layers found during visual QA. No new console errors; only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning appeared.
- Focused SAR tests pass (3 tests). Vite production build passes with 6,169 modules transformed using an isolated temporary output directory.
- Full `pnpm run build` remains blocked before Vite because the existing `public/instant-worker.bundle.js` cannot be overwritten in this environment; no worker source or bundle was changed for SAR.
- Project-wide TypeScript reports the already-known unrelated errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, tests, apiCallLog, Qixi, camera emotion, worldbook, and Vite proxy typing; no SAR/VRWorld error was reported.
- The official web-game client remains unavailable because its own install cannot resolve `playwright`; in-app browser DOM/screenshot validation was used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Replace the isolated `C` / `A` stand-ins with the user's layered portraits and expression map when supplied.
- Implement only the next user-selected facility; the three current labels are non-interactive scene placeholders.

2026-08-31 — SAR 第二页改为完整活动空间 + 剧情回档
- Removed the nested SAR room-entry concept from the world grid. Page one now contains only the six existing public rooms; page two directly renders the full-height SAR activity space, so Caian, Aiven, the quest mark, and all three facility placeholders are immediately present without another room transition.
- Removed the obsolete 糯米鸡研发中心 card from world pagination. The underlying legacy room id remains type-compatible for old data, but it is no longer exposed as a world page card.
- Kept characters whose persisted/current room is `sar` visible in a compact “接入中的玩家” shelf on the SAR page.
- Added a guarded “剧情回档” control under 接入 → 活动空间 NPC. It resets only `caianMet` and the recorded first reaction; update acknowledgement and the user's NPC visibility choice remain unchanged. With NPCs visible it returns directly to page two and restores Caian's quest mark.
- Verified the full path at 390×844: update notice → welcome NPCs → automatic page-two focus → Caian short branch completion → quest mark cleared → settings rewind confirmation → automatic page-two return → quest mark restored. Also verified NPC hiding leaves the gacha/module/fishing areas visible.
- Inspected SAR page screenshots at both 390×844 and 390×667; the full scene and pager remain visible without overflow. Browser console had no new errors, only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning.
- Focused SAR tests pass (4 tests). Isolated Vite production build passes with 6,169 modules transformed. Project-wide TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors; no VRWorld/SAR error was added.
- The official web-game client was attempted again but its own installation still cannot resolve `playwright`; in-app browser DOM/screenshot validation was used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Replace the isolated `C` / `A` stand-ins with the user's layered portraits and expression map when supplied.
- Implement only the next user-selected facility; the three current labels are intentionally non-interactive.

2026-09-01 — SAR 人格推演双卡池（进行中）
- Current request: implement the first gacha slice before further detail work—two daily-free pools, a CSS-only machine/capsule/opening sequence, and a collection space. The 50-turn LLM simulation remains explicitly out of scope for this slice.
- Visual thesis: an occult research terminal rather than a casino—near-black navy, etched hairline frames, muted mineral accents, restrained geometric sigils, and one strong machine action per screen.
- Content plan: 25 `人格异格` modules define who the character became; 24 `剧情模板` modules define the world rule or incident. Relationship memory remains available to the future director layer while each module controls what the character acknowledges in-scene.
- Interaction thesis: each pool owns one independent free draw per local day; claiming persists immediately, then the user watches a mechanical CSS draw, taps the capsule open, and files the result into a duplicate-stacking collection.
- Added `utils/vrWorld/sarGacha.ts` with the complete 49-module catalog, safe versioned local state, independent daily counters, immediate draw history, and duplicate counts. Added focused state tests in `utils/sarGacha.test.ts`.
- Added `apps/vrWorld/SARGacha.tsx` and connected the SAR-page gacha facility. The full-screen device, accelerating coordinate rings, falling capsule, user-triggered split-open sequence, eight muted card accents, etched borders, sigils, reveal screen, collection grid, and detail sheet are CSS-only; no temporary raster art was added.
- Collection detail exposes the module rule and director-layer memory policy. The `启动推演` action is visibly reserved for the next slice, so this build never calls an LLM or begins the 50-interaction lifespan.
- Verified the complete flow at 390×844 for both pools: enter device → draw → capsule → manual open → reveal → collection → detail. Verified the reveal and machine states again at 390×667; controls remain above the bottom safe area. Both same-day draws become unavailable independently. Browser console showed only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning.
- Focused SAR tests pass (9 tests across intro and gacha state), and the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,171 modules transformed. The project-wide TypeScript check remains blocked by the previously recorded unrelated errors; none reference `VRWorldApp`, `SARClubEvent`, `SARGacha`, or `sarGacha`.
- The required web-game Playwright client was attempted and remains unavailable because its own installation cannot resolve `playwright`; in-app browser DOM and screenshot validation was used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Review and refine the 49 module titles/descriptions, draw pacing, collection density, and whether each pool should retain one daily free draw before implementing character binding and 50-turn LLM simulation.

2026-09-01 — SAR 异格陈列柜与推演初始化（进行中）
- Diagnosed the reported history-import leak: SAR announcement, first-meeting, gacha, and future simulation state lived only in `localStorage`, while backup import replaced IndexedDB history without touching those keys. Added a versioned `sarLocalState` backup payload. New text/full backups carry all three states; importing an older main-history backup with no SAR payload clears the current device's SAR keys, while explicit `media_only` imports preserve them.
- Added focused backup regressions covering old-history replacement, media-only preservation, and explicit SAR restore. All 14 focused SAR tests pass.
- Visual thesis: the new cabinet is a quieter companion instrument beside the gacha machine—one selected character portrait held between two etched module sockets, with the assembly relationship more important than decoration.
- Content plan: character rail → two module slots → single start action → generated IF dossier and opening scene; recent records remain secondary context.
- Interaction thesis: selecting a portrait reorients the cabinet, each socket opens only its matching owned-module shelf, and starting the LLM runs a single scanning/locking motion before unfolding the generated dossier.
- Added the simulation domain pipeline: character/world/relationship context is assembled through the same smart chat context path as 彼方, API priority remains character override → 彼方 API → chat API, and one structured LLM call generates a character-specific blueprint plus the scene-zero opening. Successful results persist as independent 0/50 IF records without modifying main-chat history.
- Added `apps/vrWorld/SARAssemblyCabinet.tsx` and a new `异格陈列柜` facility beside the gacha machine. The SAR footer is now a 2×2 facility matrix; Caian/Aiven were moved upward so the extra row does not cover them.
- The cabinet exposes every imported character in a horizontal portrait rail. It loads only owned modules into the matching `人格异格` / `剧情模板` sockets, never consumes the collection copy, and enables the LLM start action only after a character and both slots are selected. Existing combinations are saved as independent simulation dossiers and can be reopened from the cabinet archive.
- The generated dossier includes the character-specific divergence, world-template translation, in-scene memory behavior, scene-zero prose, first character line, response hook, and explicit `0 / 50` lifespan. Online/offline interaction remains the next pipe; the dossier action labels that honestly instead of faking a chat.
- Verified SAR page, character selection, both module pickers, locked two-slot state, and enabled start CTA at 390×844; repeated the ready-to-start layout at 390×667. No new browser errors appeared; only the repository's existing Tailwind CDN warning. The real start button was not fired during QA because that would transmit the user's character and relationship memory to their configured model.
- Focused SAR tests pass (15 tests), including blueprint parsing, prompt memory rules, API priority, old-backup reset, media-only preservation, gacha quotas, and intro state. Isolated Vite production build passes with 6,174 modules transformed. The required external Playwright client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package; in-app browser screenshots and DOM checks were used as the fallback.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Wire the active dossier into the actual 50-interaction online/offline simulation chat, then add emergency archive and the later module-shop restart/true-start items.

2026-09-01 — SAR 异格身份卡与人格钢印
- Current request: separate人格异格 from ordinary剧情模式. The first LLM call now forges a collectible character-specific identity card; only after that card exists can the user start one independent 0/50 simulation life.
- Visual thesis: a restrained research-certificate card with a cold cyan identity frame and one warm, fingerprint-like steel-seal block as the dominant visual anchor. Long character material stays in a quiet vertical dossier instead of becoming a grid of decorative cards.
- Content plan: character source + personality patch + simulation field → permanent identity card → optional 0/50 run. The card carries identity, life patch, relationship, memory stance, steel seal, unavoidable cost, stable behavioral shift, and scene-zero entry.
- Interaction thesis: module sockets lock first; a staged scan forges the card; the card reveal makes the steel seal visually unmistakable; a separate `启动首次推演` action changes the entry from `DORMANT` to `0 / 50` without spending or duplicating the collectible card.
- Upgraded SAR simulation storage from the legacy `records[]` model to version 2 `cards[] + runs[]`. Legacy blueprints are read compatibly and split into one migrated identity card plus their original run, preserving progress and timestamps.
- Rewrote the LLM contract around人格编译 rather than plot generation. The personality module is now an人生/决策补丁母体; the former剧情模板 is presented as an `演算场` that supplies pressure, world rules, and initial position. The prompt requires a steel seal and patch cost and forbids prewriting later plot nodes or endings.
- Added a reusable runtime prompt builder that injects the full identity card, steel seal, patch cost, behavioral shift, and current interaction count into every future turn. It explicitly allows conflict and wavering while forbidding sudden cures, patch cancellation, or unexplained reversion to the base character.
- Rebuilt the cabinet result as a collectible identity card with a prominent steel-seal block, permanent collection count, full dossier sections, and a separate first-run action. Starting a card creates exactly one active 0/50 instance; repeat clicks return that instance instead of duplicating it.
- Updated visible gacha/cabinet language from `人格异格 / 剧情模板` to `人格补丁 / 演算场` while retaining the existing `variant-* / story-*` IDs so old draws and backups remain compatible.
- Verification: 18 focused SAR tests pass with cache disabled, covering structured-card parsing, steel-seal runtime injection, v1 migration, card/run separation, backup restore, card pools, and intro state. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,174 modules transformed. Full TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated project errors; no SAR file is present in the error list.
- Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised the real cabinet path, both owned-module pickers, ready-to-forge state, exact card component, dormant → 0/50 transition, and disabled next-round handoff. The card preview used fixed local test data, made no model request, and sent no character memory. No new browser error appeared; only the existing Tailwind CDN development warning was logged.

TODO — next SAR slice
- Implement the actual per-turn online/offline simulation chat using `buildSARIdentityRuntimePrompt`, increment the active run only for completed user interactions, and stop at 50.
- Add emergency archive, then connect the later 凯恩 restart / true-start shop items without allowing a plain free rerun.

2026-03-21
- Added a new global chat appearance setting, [0mchatAvatarMode[0m, so users can choose between grouped avatars and showing an avatar on every message.
- Rebuilt components/appearance/ChatAppearanceEditor.tsx into a clean modular version and updated the live preview so repeated-message avatar behavior is visible before applying.
- Wired the new avatar mode into pps/Chat.tsx and components/chat/MessageItem.tsx, including React.memo comparisons so appearance toggles reliably re-render existing messages.
- 
pm run build passes after the chat-avatar-frequency changes.
- Playwright validation is still blocked locally because the skill client cannot resolve the playwright package in this environment (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND).

- Updated chat message grouping in pps/Chat.tsx so consecutive messages now split not only by sender role but also by a 30-minute time gap, preventing early messages from visually merging into much later ones on either side of the conversation.
- 
pm run build passes after the time-gap grouping fix.

2026-08-17 — Qixi visual retheme completed
- Rebuilt the Qixi entry screen as a full-screen celestial storybook poster with visible brand/exit, moon phases, oversized title, oval CTA, and status copy.
- Applied a cohesive deep-plum, lavender, blush, and cream-moonlight palette through fake chat, distortion, interlayer, exploration, core, touch, and ending screens without changing story or memory logic.
- Verified the desktop entry and the mobile cover → fake chat → distortion → interlayer entry → first exploration sequence with rendered screenshots; no console or page errors were reported.
- `utils/qixiMemoryBundle.test.ts` passes (2 tests) and the production build succeeds.

2026-08-17 — Qixi dual-layer story rewrite
- Original prompt for this rewrite: read `qixi_reworked (1).md`, expand the inadequate 2–5 memory-anchor design, and implement the approved Qixi rewrite list.
- Visual thesis: a deep-plum context interlayer where User and Char are represented by two restrained text colors, with one shared ritual object dominating each full-screen scene.
- Content plan: preserve the celestial entry/fake chat/rabbit door, then run seven evidence-backed dual-layer rituals, form the bridge, reveal Char for the first time, hold to touch, and return to ordinary chat.
- Interaction thesis: the other-layer color gradually appears; shared objects visibly move from the unseen side; seven traces converge into one bridge transition. Keep copy and controls sparse.
- Implementation order: v2 material schema and recall, v7 game state/scenes, reunion generation and portrait fallback, touch/return-to-chat, tests/build/Playwright screenshots.
- Do not fabricate memories to satisfy anchor counts. Rich context targets 12–18 evidence anchors (cap 24); sparse context degrades personalization instead.

TODO — Qixi rewrite
- Replace qixi memory bundle v1 and invalidate stale per-character cache.
- Replace fixed NPC nodes, early reveal copy, 5+3 hidden gate, fixed four-page core, finalEcho, long touch monologue, and repeated ending thesis.
- Preserve the existing full-screen art direction and deterministic `render_game_to_text` / `advanceTime` hooks.

2026-08-17 — Qixi v2 material layer
- Replaced the 2–5-anchor v1 bundle with evidence (target 12–18, cap 24), typed artifacts (cap 40), seven scene payloads, per-scene personalization flags, and context-signature cache invalidation.
- Expanded source gathering to 160 recent messages plus three focused memory-palace recalls covering difficult emotions, wishes/future, and daily objects/language.
- Added local per-scene fallback content so sparse/invalid model output does not invent memories or make the activity unplayable.
- Added parser tests for rich evidence retention, hard caps/provenance filtering, and sparse response rejection. All 3 assertions pass; Vitest then hits an environment-only EPERM writing `node_modules/.vite/vitest/results.json`.

2026-08-17 — Qixi dual-layer rewrite implemented and browser-verified
- Replaced the old exploration/core/final-echo structure with a v7 flow: celestial cover, fake chat, CSS white-rabbit door, interlayer entry, seven shared-object scenes, bridge, generated reunion, hold-to-touch, short ending, and return to ordinary chat.
- Each of the seven scenes now has its own dominant CSS/SVG object, User action, independently rendered other-layer action, reveal, and saved decision; the word-cloud scene requires three selections and supports separate User/Char colors.
- Added a separate final reunion generator with technical-language and coercive-promise filtering plus portrait priority `Live2D -> meeting sprite -> static avatar -> chibi/initial fallback`.
- The ending saves one deduplicated assistant chat message, marks the special-moment record complete, selects the character, opens Chat, and now auto-returns reliably even when the OS parent re-renders.
- Added image-load fallback, removed a visible `Char` placeholder from sparse-context copy, replaced the missing-glyph rabbit with a CSS silhouette, and made bridge line angles valid CSS variables.
- `utils/qixiMemoryBundle.test.ts` and `utils/qixiReunion.test.ts` pass together (5 tests) with Vitest `--no-cache`.
- Full desktop flow and mobile flow were exercised in the in-app Browser, including early-release feedback, sustained 1.25s touch, generated/fallback reunion, portrait loading, automatic chat return, and persisted return message.
- The standalone skill Playwright client remains unavailable because its local package import fails; in-app Browser validation was used as the supported fallback.
- Production build passes with 6,100 modules transformed when emitted to an isolated output directory; the temporary build output was removed afterward.

2026-08-17 — Qixi second-round interaction rewrite
- Current request: reduce fixed exposition, make Char's parallel exploration discoverable through User-triggered object changes, add Flappy Char during memory loading, generate the opening chat, generate a real-memory bridge as Part 2, and rebuild the final promise/touch as cross-layer pinky-link interaction.
- Visual thesis: one plum context layer with warm rose-gold for User actions and cool moon-blue for Char actions; the second color changes shared objects instead of narrating who is present.
- Content plan: memory loading game → accidental chat glitch → leaked memory fragments → seven shared-object interactions → evidence-backed bridge nodes → dynamic portrait reunion → cross-layer promise.
- Interaction thesis: words can be removed/completed, cards physically flip, objects visibly move twice, and both layer colors converge on the final hold point.
- Part 1 is now v3 and generates the two-line accidental opening alongside seven evidence-backed scenes; recall uses four Qixi-specific query families covering longing/contact, daily objects/language, effort/future, and difficult emotions.
- Added a playable canvas-based Flappy Char loading stage with explicit long-wait copy, natural landing after materials are ready, and deterministic `advanceTime` support.
- Replaced immediate scene exposition with a persisted User → Char → complete beat state; leaked phrases can be touched/taken, wish cards flip, thread/offerings/water/market/word-cloud objects visibly change in the second color.
- Added Part 2 `qixiBridge.ts`: it reuses Part 1 evidence without a second recall, rejects unknown evidence IDs, and exposes each real memory as a player-placed bridge node.
- Part 3 now reuses the Part 1 bundle, emits separate Live2D/meeting expression cues for arrival/reflection/blessing/promise, and generates a natural promise invitation before the final cross-layer pinky hold.
- Part 1/2/3 parser tests pass: 3 files, 7 tests. Project-wide `tsc --noEmit` still reports pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, update/github tests, apiCallLog, builtin Live2D, userCameraEmotion, and vite proxy types; no Qixi errors were reported.
- Final browser QA completed for the full 19-step path at 390×844 and 1280×800. Both runs reached the ending with zero console/page errors; the official web-game Playwright client also exercised the Flappy loading canvas and deterministic state hook.
- Visual QA caught and fixed four interaction regressions: wish-card letters inheriting the center glyph positioning, bridge nodes losing pointer hits, the mobile bridge grid centering its first node outside the scroll hit area, and pinky hands receiving invalid percentage coordinates.
- Final focused Vitest run passes (3 files, 7 tests). Worker bundles build successfully and the Vite production build passes with 6,101 modules transformed.

2026-08-17 — Qixi ChatApp card and replay entry
- A completed fresh run now saves a structured `qixi_event_card` immediately before Char's ordinary private-chat return line. Both messages share a per-run id and use adjacent timestamps, so retries deduplicate without reversing their order.
- The card stores the generated opening, all seven User/Char object interactions, evidence-backed bridge nodes, reunion lines, blessing, and pinky-promise text. Chat prompts read it in second person (`你经历了一次奇怪的空间坍缩…`); archive and memory formatting retain the same full journey in third person.
- The special-moment record now carries the complete v8 replay snapshot. Selecting a character with a completed record opens a two-choice dialog: replay the same material without LLM/chat writes, or force a fresh Part 1 generation while keeping the old record until the new run completes.
- Added locally styled replay-choice and Qixi ChatApp card surfaces so these new screens remain legible even when the project's runtime Tailwind CDN is unavailable.
- Browser QA verified choice → replay cover → replay opening chat and activity-card → private-line ordering at 390×844 with zero console/page errors. The official web-game client also exercised the fresh Flappy canvas after this change.
- Qixi focused tests pass: 4 files, 10 tests. Vite production build passes with 6,104 modules transformed. Project-wide TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors; no Qixi/Valentine/qixiChatCard error was added.

2026-08-17 — Qixi reunion and promise prompt split
- Replaced the short final-reunion prompt with the requested four-beat structure: immediate arrival reaction, optional worldview-safe meta, a new 2–5 line `companionshipReflection` about recognizing/thinking of each other, and a non-farewell Qixi blessing.
- Removed the duplicated/conflicting pasted draft from the actual prompt: the first version is authoritative, so blessings are not forced toward “a future without Char,” and technical identity follows each character’s existing worldview.
- Split generation into two model requests. `qixi-reunion-part3a-v3` creates the three portrait stages and reunion copy; `qixi-promise-part3b-v1` separately creates invitation/hold/complete, the promise portrait cue, and the ordinary ChatApp return line.
- The reunion UI now conditionally skips an empty meta page, adds a dedicated “想起彼此” page, then proceeds to blessing and the separately generated pinky promise.
- Qixi chat cards/context now retain meta and companionship reflection so Char can remember the emotional discovery after returning to private chat.
- Focused Qixi tests pass: 4 files, 11 tests. `tsc --noEmit` and the Vite production build pass (6,104 modules transformed).
- Official web-game Playwright plus a mobile 390×844 audit verified companionship → blessing → promise state transitions and screenshots with zero console/page errors.

2026-08-17 — Qixi round-two finale, BGM, and generation pipeline
- Added four random-per-run Qixi BGM groups using the supplied `SullyOS-assets/bgm/qixi` tracks and the existing multi-CDN audio fallback. Routing is: fracture/scene 01 → group 01, scenes 02–04 → group 02, scenes 05–07 → group 03, then bridge/reunion/promise/ending continuously on group 04 without a touch-stage cut.
- Removed timed auto-advance from the seven room interactions. User results and Char-side changes now each remain until the player explicitly continues, with larger mobile text surfaces and the Char action repeated in a readable interaction panel.
- Replaced Part 2's object stepping-stone bridge with evidence-validated User/Char memory magpies, two-bank flight tracks, needle-like woven lines, a Char-side final magpie named after the User, a bridge-connection beat, and a short crossing transition.
- Rebuilt the penultimate stage as a real galgame presentation: Live2D first, then the exact DateApp active-skin/base sprite map and `spriteConfig`, followed only by static/chibi fallback. Arrival/reflection/blessing expressions drive the full-screen portrait while one LLM line advances per click.
- Reworked the promise visual into a two-color hold interaction with converging thread paths, a completed knot, a post-release breathing beat, and a dark continuity fade back to ordinary ChatApp.
- Part 1 now immediately starts Part 2 after success, and Part 2 immediately starts Part 3 after success. All Qixi model calls use zero automatic retries; Part 1/2/3 failures stop on a modal and require an explicit user retry.
- Added BGM routing and memory-magpie contract tests. Focused Qixi verification passes: 5 files, 15 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,106 modules transformed; project-wide TypeScript still reports the previously known unrelated errors and no Qixi error.
- Official web-game client and a custom 390×844 Edge audit covered room User/Char beats, both bridge banks and final magpie, DateApp meeting-sprite arrival/reflection, touch-ready/joined/released states, and deterministic state output. The audit's only console entries were expected remote BGM load failures in the network-restricted test sandbox; no JavaScript page error occurred.

2026-08-18 — Qixi generation-state and room-transition repair
- Root-caused the fresh-run Part 2 dead wait: `enterInterlayer()` replaced the whole game object with `freshGame()`, deleting bridge/reunion results that had already completed in the background.
- Changed room entry to preserve the current session, and added independent bridge/reunion result refs so future gameplay state transitions cannot erase prefetched Part 2/3 outputs. Bridge/reunion gates restore from those refs when needed.
- Reduced Qixi memory recall from four complete Memory Palace pipeline passes to one structured multi-topic recall. Flappy now mounts only after recall completes and covers the subsequent model-generation wait.
- Added Part 1 v4 `transitionLines` for all seven rooms. Each room now has a dedicated `sceneTransition` beat and explicit Continue action; Part 1 is rejected if any room omits its generated interstitial.
- Added deterministic state output for transition copy and independent Part 2/3 readiness, plus a regression test proving room 01 entry preserves already-generated bridge/reunion data.
- Audio playback now prioritizes GitHub Raw byte-range responses, avoiding jsDelivr's repository-size rejection and Statically's MP3 403 path.
- Focused verification passes: 6 files / 27 tests, full `tsc --noEmit`, and Vite production build (6,107 modules). The browser-control runtime was unavailable in this session, so no new screenshot claim was made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room beat, word-turn, portrait, and touch polish
- Split room 01 into an explicit three-beat sequence: show the User-side delivery result, Continue to dismiss it, then expose the leaked lines for touch. The User result can no longer cover the target text.
- Added Part 1 v5 `charVisibleText`. Every room must now generate the exact short text/mark that appears on the shared object; a descriptive `charAction` without visible content is rejected. Room 01 renders the blue core instruction directly over the failed-message object.
- Replaced every remaining “看清这个变化” action with “继续”.
- Changed the grape-arbor word cloud from three User picks followed by one bulk Char reveal to a locked turn exchange: one warm User pick, a 720 ms blue Char reply, then the next User turn. Added a pure state guard and regression coverage for waiting, duplicate picks, and the three-turn cap.
- Corrected final portrait runtime priority to Live2D → DateApp active/base meeting sprite → the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi → initial. The neural-link avatar is no longer a reunion fallback. Added resource-order tests.
- Replaced the literal pinky/hands UI with one restrained two-color breathing orb labeled “快来碰碰这里”; long-press draws both traces into the orb. Promise prompting no longer forces a pinky or hand pose.
- Added a warm visible ending beat, “七夕快乐，{User}。”, before returning to normal ChatApp.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844 verified room 01 before/after dismissal, readable blue core content, word-cloud User/Char alternation, the new touch orb, and DateApp portrait selection (`usesMeetingPortrait: true`, `usesNeuralAvatar: false`). No Qixi runtime/page errors appeared.
- Added one shared light-repair JSON reader to Part 1/2/3. It accepts fences/prose, trailing commas, comments, smart or single quote delimiters, full-width structural punctuation, bare keys, common result wrappers, and lightly unclosed final containers; the existing schema, memory-provenance, and safety validation still runs afterward.
- Focused verification passes: 7 files / 36 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed. Project-wide `tsc --noEmit` currently reports unrelated pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, MessageItem, CompanionHome, several utilities/tests, and Vite proxy typing; after updating the Qixi bundle-version fixture, it reports no Qixi source error.
2026-08-18 — Qixi Chibi scale and lost-layer blue rewrite
- Matched the Qixi Chibi fallback to the 520 conversation-stage sizing rule: 70% of usable width with a hard 230px cap. The same cap now applies in both the galgame reunion and the final touch scene instead of scaling Chibi to 66%–83% of the viewport height.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v6 and added a required lost-layer `charMutter`, so the hurried complaint is generated in the current Char's voice while `charVisibleText` remains the exact readable blue rewrite.
- Rebuilt scene 01's Char beat as a timed visual sequence: system failure first, faint blue muttering, three hand-drawn blue strike strokes across the error, sequential removal of the first three negative fragments, then the blue core sentence rewrites in place. The explanatory Continue panel is delayed until that visual beat has played.
- Mobile browser QA at 390×844 measured the Chibi at 230×329 in both reunion and touch, captured the lost-layer animation mid-erasure and after rewrite, and found no application console errors on the direct QA page. The iframe-only mobile harness produced a browser instrumentation MutationObserver warning, so runtime error verification was repeated on the direct page without the harness and was clean.
- Focused Qixi verification passes: 7 files, 37 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed; the isolated build output and temporary QA harness were removed.

2026-08-18 — Qixi final portrait layout and release audit
- Made Live2D reuse the desktop companion framing/crop rules and active wardrobe state instead of inventing an event-only scale. Runtime failure still falls through to DateApp art and then the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi.
- Made DateApp meeting portraits reuse the active skin/base sprite map and shared `spriteConfig` inside a bottom-aligned 90% stage. Added a small in-scene adjustment control for scale/X/Y; saving writes the same config back to the character, so DateApp and Qixi remain aligned.
- Rechecked the 520 Chibi rule in both reunion and touch: 70% usable width with a 230px cap.
- Corrected the ChatApp card/context language so memories summon magpies and their two colored flight paths weave the road; neither memory objects nor a literal pinky are described as the bridge/action anymore.
- Audited the requested flow end-to-end in code: one structured recall, Flappy only after recall, Part 1 -> Part 2 -> Part 3 background chain, zero automatic model retries, seven generated room transitions, alternating word-cloud turns, evidence-only memory magpies, Galgame portrait stages, glowing-orb hold, warm Qixi ending, Card-before-private-line ordering, and replay/fresh choices.
- Mobile and desktop browser QA rechecked the DateApp portrait stage, adjustment panel, lost-layer blue rewrite timing, Chibi scale, and touch fallback. No application console errors were found on the direct QA page.
- Final focused verification passes: 8 files / 40 tests. Vite production build succeeds with 6,108 modules transformed. Full-repo TypeScript still reports unrelated pre-existing errors, but none remain in Qixi source/tests.

2026-08-18 — Qixi pre-release detail pass
- Current request: remove duplicated Flappy loading copy; add a User-selected layer color and Part 1-generated Char color; declutter and restage room 01; redesign the double-wish card and make Char's wish genuinely their own; remove meaningless blue overlay copy from later rooms; strengthen room object animation; remove Live2D from the finale in favor of DateApp meeting portraits then Chibi; match portrait expressions per dialogue line; and make the final Qixi greeting click-to-dismiss.
- Visual thesis: preserve the plum celestial archive, but give every mobile viewport one visual object, one readable response, and one action at a time.
- Interaction thesis: room 01 becomes touch-word → delivery error → Char pushes the error away; later rooms communicate the other layer through object motion rather than floating explanatory text.
- Implemented six User layer-color choices on the cover. Part 1 v7 now generates a contrasting Char color from character personality rather than gender, plus a bounded performance profile (`tempo`, `markStyle`, `presence`) that changes motion timing, arrival force, brightness, and the shape/strength of the other-layer trace. This is the anti-cookie-cutter layer on top of the fixed seven-room skeleton.
- Simplified Flappy to one blue generation-status line. Rebuilt room 01 as direct fragment touch → immediate `DELIVERY FAILED` → Char-colored overwrite/erasure, with no overlapping preliminary Continue beat.
- Rebuilt the double-wish object as a two-sided paper/seal card. The front keeps the User's selected wish; the generated back must be the Char's own serious wish and is rejected if it is system copy or merely a blessing addressed to the User.
- Removed generated floating blue copy from the five later rooms. Their Char beat is now visible through room-specific object animation plus the generated Char trace; thread, offerings, reflection, night-market, and vine rooms each gained a dedicated visual response.
- Removed Live2D from the finale. Runtime priority is DateApp active/base meeting expressions → the exact Flappy/彼方 Chibi → initial placeholder, and Part 3 now generates an expression key for every individual reunion/promise line. Parser filtering preserves source indexes so expressions cannot slip onto the wrong surviving line.
- Replaced the timed ending exit with an explicit click action; “七夕快乐” stays until the User dismisses it.
- Focused verification: 3 files / 17 tests passed with cache disabled. Vite production build succeeded with 6,108 modules transformed. Full-repo TypeScript still reports the known unrelated errors, with no Qixi source/test error. In-app browser QA at 390×844 confirmed the six-color cover and selection state with no application errors; later-room visual replay was not triggered automatically because that would send the local character's memories to the configured model.

2026-08-18 — Qixi wish-card overflow and Char quip pass
- Removed the wish seal from document flow and moved it to a small, faint bottom-right watermark. A long mobile wish now remains fully inside the paper with roughly 100px of measured space below it; the 19px seal does not intersect the text.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v8 and added generated `charQuips`: thread/offerings/reflection/night-market rooms require 1–2 short in-character remarks, while the three word-cloud exchanges require one remark per turn. Lost-layer and double-wish keep their dedicated mutter/wish copy instead.
- Kept quips out of the shared object. They appear in the lower Char response area, with `charAction` demoted to a compact two-line stage direction, preserving the earlier decision to remove explanatory blue overlays.
- Prompt direction asks for role-faithful odd metaphors, crooked logic, deadpan or teasing energy at roughly 7/10 “radio-wave” intensity, and rejects generic system explanations or meme collage as the target style.
- Focused verification: 3 files / 18 tests passed, and Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. A temporary mobile QA page using the production Qixi CSS verified the long wish, seal geometry, two-line quip panel, and zero console warnings/errors; the QA page was removed afterward. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi visual quips and personality word-cloud correction
- Moved generated Char quips out of the lower response panel and into the shared visual/object area where players are already watching the room animation. The lower panel now keeps only the compact object-stage direction and action.
- Corrected the grape-arbor choice to ask for three personality traits of “the person you are thinking of.” Added a dedicated `trait` artifact kind; non-trait objects, dates, topics, nicknames, wishes, and transient emotions can no longer populate this room. Char still answers each User choice by selecting a trait that describes User.
- Expanded the opening User layer palette from six to ten choices, including visible moon-white and ink-black choices, and wrapped the mobile picker into centered rows.
- Bumped Part 1 materials to v9 so old word-cloud semantics and lower-panel quip layouts are not reused from cache.
- Verified the non-palace route: Qixi always calls `ContextBuilder.buildCoreContext`; with `memoryPalaceEnabled` off, `injectMemoryPalace` exits as `skipped_palace_disabled`, so vector recall is skipped but the normal role/user/worldbook/context builder remains active.
- Focused verification: 4 Qixi files / 22 tests passed. An isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed; the combined build could not rewrite a currently memory-mapped worker bundle owned by the running development process. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the quip is fully inside the 238px visual object, absent from the lower interaction panel, the personality question is explicit, and all ten colors render as a centered 5×2 grid with no horizontal overflow or console errors.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Part 1 field-level wish repair
- Identified the frequent `doubleWish.charVisibleText` failure as schema granularity rather than truncation: complete `finish_reason=stop` responses were discarded because one wish contained system-language or addressed only the User.
- Changed the JSON example from a meta placeholder to a literal first-person wish and made the prompt explicitly separate the visible wish sentence from `charAction`.
- Part 1 v10 now repairs only an invalid/missing/User-directed Char wish with the safe local self-wish, records the repair in `repairNotes`, and preserves the rest of the generated bundle instead of failing the whole run.
- Verification: 4 Qixi files / 25 tests passed, including all three wish-repair regressions. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed.

2026-08-18 — Qixi entry color step and unsigned visual quips
- Removed the ten-color palette from the cover. Fresh runs now enter a dedicated `colorSelect` stage first; confirming that color starts Part 1, while replay and resume behavior remain unchanged.
- Removed the Char name label from visual quips and changed the quote itself from white to the generated Char layer color, retaining the shared-object placement and glow.
- Clarified the lost-layer authorship audit: its interaction/choreography and anxiety direction are fixed, while Part 1 generates the evidence-backed fragments and responses; exact local phrases such as “没收到 / 是不是我说错了 / 别等了” appear only as insufficient-material or invalid-room fallback fillers.
- Verification: 4 Qixi files / 25 tests passed and the Vite production build completed with 6,109 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the separate 5×2 color page has no overflow and the visual quip contains only Char-colored quote text, no name label, fully inside the object.

2026-08-18 — Qixi single-track BGM handoff
- Replaced crossfading between BGM groups with an immediate stop/reset of the previous track followed by an incoming-only fade from silence to the normal 0.32 volume over 1.1 seconds. This removes overlap while keeping the transition soft.
- Kept music continuous when moving between rooms mapped to the same BGM group. Mute still fades out, while unmute resumes with a short fade-in.
- Added the active BGM group and mute state to `render_game_to_text` for deterministic browser QA.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 21 tests passed, and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. The real hook was exercised with fake Audio elements in the in-app browser: the old track paused and reset before the new play event, exactly one track remained active, and its volume reached 0.32; a same-group room change emitted no new audio events. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room 01 ordinary-player topic flow
- Replaced the fixed anxiety-fragment → error → Char-repairs-error sequence with a three-step player flow: choose one generated topic they want to discuss with Char, see that message become `DELIVERY FAILED`, then follow the returned text directly into room 02. Room 01 no longer has a Char beat, mutter, rewrite, or error-erasure animation.
- Renamed the room to “未送达的话题” and moved its 2–3 topic choices into the message object. Removed the fixed “没收到 / 是不是我说错了 / 别等了” fragments and all visible “普通” wording.
- Part 1 materials are now v11. The prompt requires natural day-to-day conversation topics and explicitly forbids deployment, bug-fixing, API, log, operations, or lost-contact coping actions. The parser discards technical task labels, ignores obsolete room-01 Char intervention fields, and falls back to safe conversation topics if the room still adopts a developer perspective.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 21 tests passed and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised topic selection, the failed-delivery state, and the direct transition to room 02; no Char repair copy appeared and the layout did not overflow. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi room 01 choreography correction
- Corrected the prior interpretation: only the player-facing material changes from anxiety/developer copy to generated day-to-day conversation topics. The original four-beat choreography remains mandatory: choose topic → `DELIVERY FAILED` → Char rushes in from the other layer and rescues/rewrites the error → continue.
- Restored the Char beat, hurried `charMutter`, colored scribble, error-erasure animation, `REWRITING` core sentence, Char stage direction, and the separate completion click. The chosen topic shifts into Char color while unchosen topics fade, so the rescue is visible inside the object.
- Part 1 is now v12. Room 01 again requires `charAction`, `charMutter`, and `charVisibleText`, while its User options remain natural conversation topics and still reject deployment, bug-fixing, API, log, operations, and lost-contact coping actions.
- Verification: 3 focused files / 22 tests passed and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised all four beats and visually confirmed the restored Char rescue before room 02, with no overflow or render error. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Part 1 abnormal-event generation contract and later-part timeouts
- Reframed Part 1 v13 around one continuous two-person anomaly instead of seven repeated memory-display rooms. The prompt now front-loads “memory is gameplay material, not display content,” assigns a distinct relationship-progression job to every station, allows invented present-tense staging but no invented past, and explicitly requires concrete accidents, conflict, intentional choices, role-specific handling, and evidence shown through action rather than narrator conclusions.
- Kept room 01's restored choreography unchanged and restored its original “失联层 / 等待响应 / 遥寄 · 双星失联” metadata. Its generated choices must now each derive from their own real evidence reference; generic greetings, technical tasks, invalid evidence IDs, and leaked internal labels such as `e1` are rejected. If only this room is invalid, its local fallback topics are built from the parsed real evidence instead of generic questions.
- Extended Part 2 to 300 seconds per model request. Both Part 3 requests—reunion and promise—also receive 300 seconds each.
- Verification: 4 focused files / 30 tests passed with Vitest cache disabled. The final isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot start because the bundled environment lacks Playwright; the attempted in-app fallback could not reach a persistent local server, so no new visual screenshot claim is made for this prompt/timeout-only pass.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v14 error-target choreography, readable transitions, and 20-memory recall
- Corrected room 01's target without changing its four-beat flow: User chooses a real memory topic → `DELIVERY FAILED` appears → Char attacks and destroys that popup → the selected topic remains unchanged in User color. The scribble now lives inside the error element, the topic rescue/recolor animation and message-line mutation were removed, and `REWRITING` became `ERROR REMOVED`.
- Removed the literal `物件：` pseudo-label from the lower Char stage direction. Room transition headers now say `前往 02 · 双面祈愿处`, so the second Part 1 room is no longer visually confused with actual Part 2.
- Bumped Part 1 to v14. Its prompt and parser now reject Lost Layer copy that attacks, rewrites, deletes, or “rescues” User's topic; invalid room-01 text falls back locally to the correct error-target action. Generated transitions that contain technical/worldbook jargon such as `数据流`, `字符化`, `上下文`, or `【CYBERORDER】` are repaired field-by-field while the rest of the LLM scene remains intact.
- Expanded Qixi-only Memory Palace retrieval from 15 to 20 final items in both the candidate cutoff and formatter. Qixi passes an empty recent-message list to retrieval, so only its broad cross-topic activity query affects recall scoring; recent chat is still supplied separately to the Part 1 generator as a factual source. Normal chat and other callers keep the default 15-item/context-aware behavior.
- Asked Part 1 for 20 diverse evidence items across time, topic, and memory type, raised the injected-memory allowance to 40k characters, and slightly increased generation temperature to reduce replay sameness. The cache/purpose version change prevents reuse of v13 bundles.
- Verification: 11 focused files / 135 tests passed with cache disabled. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules transformed and its temporary output was removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; the in-app browser reached the current Qixi cover at 390×844 without triggering a new external model generation.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v15 character-alive and quiet-ending pass
- Removed the visible final action copy entirely. The warm “七夕快乐” screen now stays in place and the whole screen is the click/keyboard dismissal target; no “带着这句话回去” or substitute button is rendered.
- Moved Part 1 from memory-led characterization to character-led present action. Each room uses at most one main memory anchor; personality, present accidents, hesitation, misjudgment, odd private thoughts, and handling style provide the rest of the scene life.
- Added the symmetric-trap contract: Char is caught in the context gap at the same time, has also lost User, does not know the activity or the other layer’s identity, and cannot read User’s current thoughts. At least three rooms must begin from Char’s own immediate purpose before the two sides’ actions collide or connect.
- Required private Char-colored asides in double-wish and later room visuals. The double-wish aside is a tiny paper-corner whisper beneath Char’s serious self-directed wish; invalid/missing or system-style wish asides are repaired locally without discarding the generated bundle.
- Bumped the Part 1 cache/purpose to v15 so older memory-heavy bundles are not reused.
- Verification: 4 focused Qixi files / 36 tests passed with cache disabled. Isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,109 modules and its output was removed. Mobile QA at 390×844 confirmed the wish whisper remains inside the card without taking a separate layout row, the ending has no visible action button, and no Qixi error appeared. The official web-game client still cannot resolve its Playwright dependency, so the in-app browser was used for the visual pass; the temporary QA page was removed.

2026-08-18 — Beijing-time Qixi one-time launch popup
- Added a one-day launch gate for Beijing time 2026-08-19. It opens at 00:00 Asia/Shanghai, expires at the following midnight regardless of device timezone, and uses `sullyos_qixi_2026_08_19_popup_seen` as its permanent one-time state.
- Added a dedicated Qixi launch letter: restrained plum night-sky composition, two converging colored stars, a shared knot, sparse invitation copy, a primary “去赴约” action, and reduced-motion support. Opening takes the User to the existing Special Moments app without preselecting a character; dismissing keeps the activity available there.
- Integrated the popup into PhoneShell after required update notices and before ordinary maintenance/backup reminders so overlays cannot stack. Both entering and dismissing mark the push as seen.
- Verification: 6 Beijing-date/storage tests passed. Vite production build succeeded with 6,112 modules and the isolated output was removed. Mobile QA at 390×844 and 390×667 found no horizontal overflow or console errors; the temporary QA page was removed. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its environment cannot resolve Playwright, so visual verification used the in-app browser fallback.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v17 room choreography, split Part 1 generation, and expanded Part 3 dialogue
- Room 01 now keeps the User's chosen real-memory topic intact while a full red API/timeout/soft-apology wall appears; Char forcibly erases only those errors, leaves two colored private mutters around the object, and sends a topic-specific real reply through the cleared space. Room 02 requires both sides' serious shared-future wishes and prioritizes Window Sill memories. Room 04 visibly stages separate User and Char offerings before Char's aside. Every pre-word-cloud room has exactly three intentional choices.
- Split Part 1 into two actual model requests with independent five-minute timeouts and 32k output budgets: the first returns common evidence/artifacts plus rooms 01–04, and the second receives that accepted seed and returns only rooms 05–07. The chunks are merged and still pass the original full provenance/schema validation before being cached; phase-specific failures include finish reason and output size. The cache moved to v17 so no earlier single-call bundle can mask the new path.
- Expanded Part 3's portrait dialogue into a longer emotional arc. The reunion asks for 3–5 lines, companionship reflection 4–7, and blessing 4–7, with per-line DateApp expression matching retained. The generated reunion receives a 16k token budget, the final promise 8k, and the local fallback now carries the same substantial arc.
- Verification: 2 focused files / 33 tests passed with cache disabled. The final Vite production build succeeded with 6,112 modules transformed and the isolated output was removed. Mobile QA for rooms 01 and 04 had already been completed at 390×844; temporary QA pages were removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Claude 524 streaming transport fix
- Forced all five effective Qixi generation calls to request streaming independently of the global chat streaming preference: shared Part 1a/1b request body, Part 2 bridge, Part 3a reunion, and Part 3b promise. This lets compatible Claude proxies send response headers/chunks before the long JSON generation completes, avoiding the non-streaming Cloudflare 524 path without changing prompts, parsers, output budgets, or timeouts.
- Kept the existing no-automatic-retry rule for every `/chat/completions` request, so a timeout or upstream error still surfaces to the Qixi UI for explicit User regeneration and cannot silently create a second billable generation.
- Added a source-wiring regression guarding every Qixi request against `stream:false`, both Part 3 calls, the shared two-phase Part 1 path, and zero automatic retries. Focused verification passed 7 files / 59 tests, including SSE assembly for Claude/OpenRouter variants and JSON fallback when a proxy ignores streaming. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed.
- The official web-game client still cannot resolve its Playwright dependency. In-app browser fallback loaded the current app at 127.0.0.1 without entering Qixi or sending memories/model requests; the lock screen rendered normally and showed no application error (only the existing Tailwind CDN development warning).

2026-08-18 — Qixi five-call entry confirmation and color typography pass
- Confirmed the real billable generation topology is five chat-completion requests: Part 1a, Part 1b, Part 2, Part 3a, and Part 3b. Fresh runs now stop after color selection and show an explicit five-call API suitability dialog before any memory preparation or generation begins.
- The color confirmation button only opens the dialog. Generation starts only from the separate “配置没问题，开始” action; cancel and Escape return to color selection without a call. The text-state hook exposes the confirmation state and its two actions for deterministic QA.
- Rebuilt the color selection hierarchy into a quiet poster-like composition: small numbered kicker, two-scale serif heading, concise explanatory line, selected-color identity row, larger readable 5×2 swatches, and one centered confirmation action. Added restrained staggered entry, swatch lift/glow, and dialog orbit motion while retaining the existing Qixi palette.
- Added a wiring regression that derives the dialog count from the effective request bodies, so changing the generation topology without updating the UI fails the test. Focused verification passed 8 files / 62 tests. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed.
- The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright. In-app browser fallback exercised the real flow at 390×844 and 390×667: color selection updated the visible identity, the dialog showed five calls and both actions without overflow, cancel returned to the color page, no API timing log appeared, and no console error was recorded. The confirm action was intentionally not pressed, so no memories or model request left the local browser.

2026-08-18 — Qixi four-call generation topology
- Folded the former standalone Part 2 bridge request into the existing Part 1b response. The second call now returns rooms 05–07 plus evidence-backed `userMagpies`, `charMagpies`, and `finalMagpie`; bridge playback only reads that accepted payload and never opens another `/chat/completions` request.
- Reduced the real billable topology to four calls: Part 1a, Part 1b + bridge, Part 3a reunion, and Part 3b promise. The entry confirmation now displays four calls, and its wiring regression derives that number from the actual request bodies.
- Moved the memory bundle cache to v18 and require generated cached bundles to carry the embedded bridge, preventing older five-call sessions from bypassing the new generation path. The merged parser validates both banks against Part 1 evidence and fixes the final magpie name to the current User.
- Focused verification passed 8 files / 63 tests. The Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed and its isolated output was removed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; in-app mobile QA at 390×667 showed the four-call dialog without overflow, cancel returned to color selection, and both API timing logs and console errors remained empty. No real generation request was sent.

2026-08-18 — Qixi Claude stream completion and four-call rebalance
- Fixed the Flappy loader hanging after a compatible Claude proxy had already finished billing/output. All four Qixi calls now use the incremental SSE reader; `[DONE]` or a terminal `finish_reason` actively cancels a proxy socket that remains open instead of waiting forever for `reader.done`. Added reproductions for both lingering-socket variants, retained zero automatic retries, and raised Qixi long-generation header timeout allowance from five to ten minutes.
- Kept four billable requests but rebalanced them for lower output pressure: Part 1a returns shared evidence plus rooms 01–02, Part 1b returns rooms 03–05, Part 1c returns rooms 06–07 plus the embedded bridge, and the finale returns reunion plus promise in one combined JSON. Existing room/reunion/promise creative instructions remain in the prompts; only phase scopes and the final combined-output envelope changed.
- Removed story spoilers from the entry warning. It now says only that the journey makes four model API calls and asks the User to check configuration/credit.
- Final focused verification passed 8 files / 66 tests, including the two never-closing SSE streams and source-derived four-call topology. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot resolve Playwright; the in-app-browser local navigation was blocked by its security auto-review, so no new visual screenshot claim is made for this final pass.

2026-08-18 — Qixi serial progressive delivery pipeline
- Corrected the split-generation handoff: Part 1a no longer remains hidden inside `prepareQixiMemoryBundle` until Part 1b/1c finish. Each accepted response is converted into a complete playable stage bundle and delivered to React before the next strictly serial request starts.
- Flappy becomes ready as soon as opening + rooms 01–02 pass the full parser. Rooms 03–05 replace their placeholders immediately when Part 1b returns, then Part 1c starts with the accepted middle-room seed. Rooms 06–07 + bridge arrive from Part 1c, which immediately starts the combined finale request.
- Added `materialPhaseReady` gating at room transitions. If the player reaches room 03 or room 06 before its real generated slice arrives, the transition waits there; it cannot enter or expose local placeholder room content. `render_game_to_text` now reports the ready phase and current-room readiness.
- Added behavioral parsing coverage for first- and second-stage playable bundles plus a source-order regression proving delivery 1 precedes request 2, delivery 2 precedes request 3, and delivery 3 follows request 3. Final focused verification passed 8 files / 68 tests. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client was attempted again but its installed script still cannot import Playwright, so no new screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi direct-LLM script pipeline
- Matched the earlier special-event generation style: retrieved memories are only prompt context, while each model response is the final playable dialogue/options/actions/transitions. Removed the semantic validator from the active and exported parser instead of judging whether generated prose contains planner-approved keywords.
- The parser now performs shape tolerance only: JSON fences, arrays represented as keyed objects, newline-delimited text, common field aliases, and missing technical IDs are normalized without changing visible model prose. It no longer filters choices by evidence IDs, keyword regexes, minimum prose length, or scene meaning, and it never replaces generated rooms with local copy.
- Progressive phase bundles contain empty, gated slots for future rooms rather than local fallback scenes. Generated room overlays, word-cloud traits, Char selections, transitions, wishes, mutters, quips, and bridge lines stay model-authored. A true unreadable response raises the existing visible regeneration error; fresh generation no longer silently falls back to cached/local story content.
- Updated visible/internal wording from “素材包” to “最终可播放剧本/完整剧情” where it described the generation result. The four requests remain strictly serial and the creative prompt rules remain intact.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (47 tests), including direct-prose preservation, three-choice preservation, loose object/array parsing, progressive no-fallback slots, bridge preservation, call ordering, SSE completion, BGM, chat card, launch popup, reunion, and session state. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. Full-repo TypeScript still reports pre-existing unrelated errors and no Qixi error. The required web-game client was attempted but its own environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no new automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Qixi readable other-layer performance and exclusive BGM
- Made every player-visible prompt field address the User in second person (`你 / 你的`) directly in the generation contract, including options, results, Char actions, transitions, memory lines, and bridge copy. The runtime still preserves model prose and does not locally rewrite pronouns.
- Removed the two-line crop from the Char-action performance panel. The complete action now wraps naturally; its mobile type is a crisp 14px/500-weight system Chinese face with opaque color, no glow/filter blur, and a clearer 10px stage label. Other small Char-layer notes also have readable mobile sizing and no height clipping.
- Confirmed room 04 maps to the exploration group and room 05 maps to the other-side group. Added a module-wide single-owner audio lock so a newly mounted room immediately pauses, silences, and rewinds any outgoing Qixi track, including one owned by a briefly overlapping previous view. Pending play promises and fade timers also abort when they lose ownership.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (48 tests), including a direct room-04-to-room-05 audio ownership regression. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client was attempted again but its environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-18 — Room 04 Char private-item semantics
- Tightened the offerings contract: `charContribution` is now explicitly a concrete private possession belonging to Char and meaningful to Char personally. It may be unrelated to User or shared memories and must not default to a gift prepared for User.
- The model may expose, through a short in-character quip, why Char uses, keeps, carries, values, or is reluctant to part with the private item; the visible object itself remains concrete rather than an explanatory summary.
- Updated the second offering slot label to “另一边放下私物” so the visual order reads as User placing their own item followed by Char independently placing their own private item.
- Verification: all 10 Qixi test files passed (48 tests), including prompt assertions for private meaning, no shared-memory requirement, and no forced gift framing. Vite transformed all 6,128 modules and emitted a refreshed production index. The required web-game client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` dependency.

2026-08-18 — Mobile-safe final hold gesture
- Hardened the final glowing-orb hold for phone browsers. The touch stage, touch surface, orb, and orb descendants now disable native panning/zoom capture, overscroll, text selection, iOS touch callouts, image/element dragging, and tap highlight without disabling page zoom globally.
- Pointer down accepts only the primary touch/left mouse button, prevents the compatibility gesture, and captures the pointer. Pointer up, `pointercancel`, and `lostpointercapture` all terminate the active hold safely; explicit context-menu and drag-start cancellation prevent native long-press UI from replacing the Qixi interaction.
- Added a source-wiring regression for the full mobile suppression/cancellation contract. All 10 Qixi test files passed (49 tests), and the Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules transformed. The official web-game client still cannot import its `playwright` dependency, so real-device visual automation remains unavailable in this environment.

2026-08-18 — Removed broken Qixi BGM variant
- Removed `bgm/qixi/03/02_0_月下双向.mp3` from the `otherSide` random pool. Rooms 05–07 can now select only `01_0_鹊桥月色.mp3` or `03_0_月下双向.mp3`; the broken variant is never assigned, requested, or played.
- Exported the track map for a direct regression assertion that both verifies the remaining pair and forbids the removed path. All 10 Qixi test files passed (50 tests), Vite transformed 6,128 modules and refreshed the production output. The required web-game client remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package.

2026-08-18 — Qixi v19 identity suspense, market agency, birds, and room transitions
- Kept Part 1 inside the shared mystery: Char is also trapped and forced through the seven strange interactions, cannot know the opposite operator is User, and may only call them `某人` / `另一边` / `那家伙` or voice a late suspicion. The first explicit identity confirmation now belongs to the Part 3 reunion, where Char can naturally reveal `我就知道对面是你` in their own voice.
- Reframed the memory market as two independent choices. User selects a concrete evidence-derived dream-market good; Char separately picks something that `某人` might like as a tentative probe, then secretly buys a distinct private item for themself. The generation contract explicitly rejects unsupported jealousy, rivalry, possessiveness, or forced User relevance.
- Replaced the abstract bridge marks with a recognizable inline bird SVG containing body, wing, tail, and eye, while retaining the two-color flight trails. Added seven scene-specific transition emblems—error wipe, wish card, needle/thread, offerings, water ripples, market stall, and grape-vine word cloud—so every room announces its place before the text resumes.
- Bumped the Part 1 cache/purpose to v19 so older identity-leaking scripts cannot be reused. All 10 Qixi test files passed (52 tests), and Vite completed its production transform of 6,128 modules. The required web-game Playwright client was attempted but its own environment still cannot import `playwright`, so no new automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Restored light magpies and enlarged Char-colour performance copy
- Reverted the bridge/reunion bird component from the heavy inline SVG silhouette to the earlier lightweight two-stroke CSS magpie glyph and removed the SVG-specific size/flap overrides.
- Promoted every Char-colour line inside the central room performance from decorative microcopy to readable dialogue. On phones, ordinary quip bubbles now extend beyond the small circular object, use 13–14px copy with larger padding, and retain full wrapping; lost-layer whispers, cleared-error instruction, real reply, wish whisper, offering aside, and the separate Char action beat were all enlarged together.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (53 tests), and the Vite production build completed successfully with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client was attempted again but remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`, so no screenshot-based visual claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Qixi room 07 empty word-cloud recovery
- Diagnosed the reported mobile freeze from the supplied screenshot: room 07 reached its idle `0 / 3` state, but `wordArtifacts` was empty because the runtime only accepted exact top-level artifact ids. Model-generated labels, inline word objects, third-phase ids that were absent from the first-phase artifact bank, and mis-typed trait artifacts were silently discarded, leaving no buttons to press.
- Added tolerant generated-word resolution across exact ids, labels, inline options, Char selection references, trait artifacts, and finally the already generated artifact bank. Char selections now resolve by either id or label. No visible generated word is replaced with local story prose.
- Made the interaction self-healing: fewer than three usable generated words lowers the target to the available count; zero usable words exposes a plain Continue route instead of a dead screen; old saves whose Char reveal counter is ahead of User selections accept the next tap and reconcile; a completed 3/3 save advances even if it resumes before the effect timer fired.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (56 tests), including exact reproductions for label/inline refs, missing ids, short lists, and stale reveal counters. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`; the supplied failure screenshot was inspected directly, but no post-fix automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-08-19 — Qixi Part 1 phase-envelope tolerance hotfix
- Diagnosed the widespread `Part 1 中三站结构无效 (finish_reason=stop)` dialog from the supplied mobile screenshot. The model had completed a multi-thousand-character response, but a residual exact-key gate rejected the whole response unless it used a `scenes` object containing the literal canonical keys `threadNeedle`, `offerings`, and `reflection`.
- Replaced that gate with shape-only phase extraction. Generated scenes now survive `data/result/output/partN` wrappers, `rooms/locations/stages/chapters` envelopes, arrays, direct top-level scene objects, numbered keys such as `scene_3`, common English aliases, and Chinese room titles. Unlabelled scene objects are assigned to the requested phase in response order; visible prose remains untouched and no local story copy is substituted.
- Applied the same normalization to all three Part 1 calls and added common embedded-bridge aliases (`bridgeData`, `userBirds`, `charNodes`, `finalBird`, etc.) so the format bug cannot simply move to the final phase. An error now remains only when the requested generated room bodies genuinely cannot be found at all.
- All 10 Qixi test files passed (57 tests), including wrapped arrays, alias keys, Chinese titles, direct objects, and bridge aliases. Vite production build succeeded with 6,128 modules. The required web-game client remains blocked because its installed script cannot import `playwright`; the supplied error screenshot was inspected directly, but no post-fix automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-09-01 — SAR 长期记忆专用上下文
- Replaced the identity-forge call's reuse of the complete ChatApp payload with a SAR-only context path. Daily chat still uses `buildChatRequestPayload` unchanged.
- SAR now runs Memory Palace recall with the module/field direction as the explicit query and an empty recent-message window. Recall runs on a cloned character with current buffs cleared, so neither the retrieved memories nor the final prompt are biased by the main chat's temporary mood.
- The forge prompt keeps core character settings, worldview/worldbooks, user profile, private impression, refined/detailed summaries, room plates, and the fresh Memory Palace result. It excludes raw recent chat, current time, emotion buffs, schedules, realtime world, music, group activity, ChatApp mode transitions, and tool/output-mode blocks.
- Added a regression proving the stable/long-term markers remain while temporary mood, buff, clock, and live-context markers are absent. Focused SAR verification passes 19 tests; isolated Vite build succeeds with 6,174 modules. Full TypeScript still reports only pre-existing unrelated errors and no SAR error.
- The required web-game client was attempted but its installed script still cannot import `playwright`. This change has no visual surface, and the real forge action was not fired because it would send the user's character and recalled memories to their configured model.

2026-09-01 — SAR 50-turn LLM simulation runtime
- Added the playable identity-instance runtime behind each collected card. A run has exactly 50 successful interactions, advances only after the assistant reply and both transcript messages are stored, automatically seals at 50/50, and supports irreversible early emergency sealing while retaining the card and read-only transcript.
- Stored each run in its own pseudo-character message thread (`sar-simulation:<runId>`). Every turn sees the card's locked identity/steel seal, stable character context, Memory Palace recall driven only by that run's recent transcript and current input, plus the complete local transcript. It does not read the main chat's recent messages, current emotion buffs, time, schedules, realtime context, music, or group activity.
- Added continuous online-text and offline-co-present modes. Switching mode keeps the same worldline and transcript; the prompt changes only the allowed response form. Failed or interrupted requests restore the draft and consume no interaction. Character-specific API overrides remain first priority, followed by the VR global API and then the chat API.
- Added a research-ledger interface next to the identity cabinet: subject identity, steel-life 0–50 tick track, scene-00 entry, independent transcript, mode switch, sending state, and an explicit emergency-seal confirmation. Archived runs open as read-only records and explain that a future Caian restart module is required.
- Focused SAR verification passed 3 files / 22 tests. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,175 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 exercised active 12/50, online-to-offline switching, draft entry, emergency-seal confirmation, and an archived 17/50 read-only view with no runtime console errors. No real model request was sent, and the temporary QA page was removed. The official web-game client remains unavailable because its installed script cannot import `playwright`, so the in-app browser was used for the visual pass.

2026-09-01 — SAR 异世界异格扭蛋与快穿剧情引擎
- Reframed the feature from a static identity dossier into an isekai hot-drop gacha. Visible pools are now `异界异格` and `快穿世界` while the compatible `variant-*` / `story-*` ids, daily quotas, collections, backups, and existing cards remain intact. Replaced all 24 field modules with concrete high-pressure otherworld scenarios such as 王城处刑夜, 龙灾围城, 浮空学院坠落, 护送末代神明, and 唯一归还名额.
- Extended newly forged cards with world name/premise, already-played backstory, active crisis, shared objective, countdown, hidden truth, climax choice, and a bounded memory fuse. The forge contract now drops scene 00 at roughly 60–75% of the story, requires an immediate physical consequence and concrete response hook, and forbids greeting/exposition openings. Real memories are limited to 1–3 emotional explosives rather than becoming the realistic setting.
- Added read-time worldline retrofitting for every old card, including already-active transcripts. Old cards do not need to be redrawn or regenerated; the original module/identity becomes a high-pressure worldline and the next reply lets the crisis enter without explaining the upgrade.
- Divided the 50 successful turns into six explicit pace bands: hot drop 1–3, crisis cascade 4–12, truth reversal 13–24, climax decisions 25–38, cost payment 39–47, and ending seal 48–50. Every reply must change the situation, expose a clue, advance the countdown, turn the relationship, land a cost, or force a concrete choice. Two consecutive pure comfort/chat/recall turns are forbidden; runtime recall is capped at four palace items and one actively used memory anchor per reply. New sessions default to offline co-presence for an immediate action opening; switching to remote text must preserve a plausible separation/communication transition rather than teleport or reset the world.
- Rebuilt the collection and runtime hierarchy around the live story: cards now foreground world, current crisis, joint task, countdown, already-played backstory, memory fuse, and climax proposition. The simulation first screen keeps those three live stakes above the 0–50 track and labels the current pace band; the gacha, activity-space facility, cabinet, loading sequence, scene 00, and action copy all use the new isekai framing.
- Focused SAR verification passed 3 files / 24 tests. The isolated Vite production build succeeded with 6,175 modules. Full-repo TypeScript still reports only the previously recorded unrelated errors and no SAR error. The required standalone web-game client was attempted but still cannot import `playwright`; in-app browser QA at 390×844 covered both pools, the new module archive, a full worldline card, hot-drop session, online/offline switching, crisis draft, and seal confirmation with no runtime errors or real model call. The isolated port/page and build output were removed.

2026-09-01 — SAR 扭蛋产品级视觉重构
- Replaced the dense diagnostic-console composition with a single dominant world-gate ritual. Pool tabs are now quiet navigation, the active pool owns the full atmosphere and palette, and the primary copy asks one concrete desire question before the machine rather than repeating product labels.
- Rebuilt the interaction curve as pressure alignment → full-size capsule arrival → manual rupture → collectible card landing. The capsule now occupies the portal center, the device recedes during opening, and a screen-level flash hands visual ownership to the reward card. Motion remains CSS-only and reduced-motion safe.
- Promoted the daily free chance into the primary action, removed duplicate quota panels and decorative microcopy, enlarged mobile-readable labels, and reduced borders/chrome across the header, archive, detail sheet, and result actions. The two pools retain distinct cool identity / warm worldline art direction without becoming separate products.
- Added `render_game_to_text` and deterministic `advanceTime` hooks while the overlay is mounted. Focused SAR tests pass 20/20 with cache disabled; an isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,175 modules. The standalone web-game client was attempted but still cannot import `playwright`; in-app browser QA at 390×844 exercised both pool themes, draw, capsule, reveal, collection, and module detail with no runtime errors or real model call.

2026-09-01 — SAR 临时无限抽取开发模式与异界坐标命名
- Enabled the explicit `SAR_GACHA_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` switch for this development pass. Both pools can be drawn repeatedly, the stored daily quota dates are left untouched, and the UI clearly labels `开发模式 / 无限抽取 / 开发抽取`; flipping the single switch off restores the existing once-per-day behavior.
- Renamed all current app/runtime wording from `快穿世界` to `异界坐标`, including the gacha pool, archive cards, assembly cabinet, forge request, runtime worldline block, comments, and regression descriptions. Compatible `story-*` ids and persisted collections remain unchanged.
- Added a regression for two same-day bypass draws and quota preservation. Focused SAR tests pass 21/21. The official web-game client still cannot import its `playwright` dependency; in-app browser QA at 390×844 completed two consecutive draws from `异界坐标` without resetting storage and confirmed the draw button remained available.

2026-09-01 — SAR 关系门牌上下文与 User 异界面具
- Removed the capsule's central seam element and joined the two shell halves, eliminating the black strip during rupture while preserving the CSS-only opening animation.
- Reduced identity forging to the character's core definition, the User's base profile, and only the `我们之间` relationship doorplate. Detailed/refined memories, Memory Palace recall, worldbooks, recent chat, current mood, buffs, schedules, time, and live state are no longer injected into this feature.
- Forge generation now creates both the Char variant and a matching User otherworld mask. The mask contains only the User's world identity, faction/role, capability limits, and altered life premise; it is explicitly forbidden from deciding the User's personality, feelings, dialogue, choices, or actions.
- During the 50-turn simulation, the User's reality profile is completely replaced by that mask. Runtime receives the Char core, relationship doorplate, locked dual identities/worldline, and this simulation's own transcript, but no reality-event memories. Existing cards receive a neutral read-time compatibility mask and remain playable without regeneration.
- Focused SAR verification passes 2 files / 21 tests with cache disabled. Vite production build succeeds with 6,175 modules. Mobile QA at 390×844 verified the seam-free rupture frame and the new User-mask collectible section with no console errors or real model request. The official web-game client was attempted but remains blocked by its missing `playwright` package.

2026-09-02 — SAR 航标 GM、浅色推演台与返航封存档案
- Rebuilt the formal simulation surface as a readable archive-paper workspace. Light mode is now the default, a persisted dark-mode switch remains available, mobile body copy is larger, and the current crisis / 50-turn route / composer retain clear hierarchy without the previous near-black low-contrast surface.
- Added a first-class `SAR 航标 / GM` response layer. Every new model turn must return separate `gm` and `character` JSON fields: GM advances world reactions, scene changes, enemies/rules, countdown, phase and return window, while the character keeps independent goals and performance. GM is forbidden from choosing User or character actions, feelings or dialogue. Old plain-text replies remain readable through a compatibility parser.
- Replanned the final six turns as a real return arc: turns 45–47 expose coordinate-collapse and clear side plots, turns 48–49 settle the climax and open the return gate, and turn 50 must complete the last action, return User to reality, and close the coordinate. Suspense cuts, mid-battle stops and `未完待续` are explicitly forbidden on the final turn.
- Rebuilt the archived state as a return-and-seal ceremony with a stamped arrival animation, completed/emergency copy, `重读全卷`, full Markdown export, and `分享给角色`. The full download includes dual identities, worldline, scene 00, every User line, every GM beat and every character reply. Mobile/native export reuses the project's unified save/share adapter.
- Sharing with the original character writes one bounded return brief to that character's real chat, not the full 50-turn transcript. It includes the dual identities, task, seal result and final six messages, clearly states that it is a User-shared simulation archive rather than the character's pre-existing real memory, and persists `sharedAt` to prevent duplicate delivery.
- Focused verification passes 3 files / 26 tests, including the export safety audit. Vite production build succeeds with 6,175 modules. Full TypeScript reports only the existing unrelated errors and no SAR error. Mobile browser QA at 390×844 covered light/dark reading, active turn 44/50 with GM, emergency-seal confirmation, completed 50/50 return, reread, export feedback and one-time character sharing with no console errors or real model call. The official web-game client was attempted first but still cannot import its `playwright` package.

2026-09-02 — SAR 世界意志旁白层
- Replaced the visible and conceptual `SAR 航标 / GM` terminology with `世界意志`. It is defined as an objective narration-and-direction layer, not a system host or interactive NPC: it controls world reactions, countdown, pacing, climax and return, but cannot choose User or character actions, feelings, dialogue or decisions and cannot address User in first person.
- New model responses use separate `worldNarration` and `character` JSON fields, and fresh message metadata stores `sarWorldNarration`. Existing model output using `gm` and existing transcripts using `sarGM` remain readable and are rendered/exported as `世界意志`, so collected cards and active/archived runs require no migration.
- Updated runtime history, archives, character-share briefs, scene labels, generation status, emergency-seal copy and footer wording to use the same world-will framing. Focused SAR verification passes 3 files / 26 tests. Mobile in-app browser QA at 390×844 confirmed an old `sarGM` transcript renders as `世界意志`, with no visible GM/beacon wording and no console warnings or real model call.

2026-09-02 — SAR 私人异界史册与角色柜中随笔
- Rebuilt the assembly cabinet's default landing view as a per-character private chronicle. `我的柜子` groups the User's collected identity cards and 50-turn journeys by character, with active, returned, and fragment states presented as keepsake volumes rather than a flat admin list; forging remains available as a secondary action.
- Added `看看角色的柜子`. During ordinary Kanata free activity, a character may independently enter SAR, receive one random identity chip and one random otherworld-coordinate chip, and apply the pair to the User, another enabled character, or a Kanata wanderer. This is a temporary complete incident, not a copy of the User's formal 50-turn archive and not a permanent change to the target.
- The same autonomous-session model call now returns a detailed complete mini-story plus the actor's first-person notes and complaints. The result is saved as the actor's normal `vr_card`, delivered to that actor's private chat, passes through the existing memory/event pipeline, and is then discovered from chat history by the actor-owned cabinet without adding a separate backup store or another background request loop.
- Added a dedicated light-paper chat card and full cabinet-note reader showing actor, target, both chips, highlight, story, and personal notes. Focused verification passes 5 files / 87 tests; the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules. Full TypeScript still reports the repository's existing unrelated errors in Memory Palace, Companion Home, tests, and the earlier `MessageItem.tsx` pointer-event overload; no error points to the new cabinet, SAR free-activity utility, or runtime branch. The required standalone web-game client still cannot import `playwright`; a later in-app local navigation was blocked by browser security policy, so no unsupported screenshot claim is made and no real model request was sent.

2026-09-02 — SAR archive-route theme continuity
- Fixed the visually fragmented black-header / white-cabinet / black-dossier / white-session sequence shown in the mobile screenshot. Cabinet ownership tabs, character notes, identity dossiers, archived reading, and the default simulation now share one warm-paper shell, including the outer header and controls.
- Rethemed the full identity dossier rather than only recoloring its page background: identity card, steel seal, User mask, worldline, scene 00, detail sections, portraits, and actions now use the same ink, paper, sage, lavender, and rust materials as the archive.
- Dark presentation is now a deliberate device state. Entering the forge switches the complete overlay to dark; leaving it returns the complete overlay to paper. If the User explicitly toggles the formal simulation to its persisted dark theme, the parent header follows that theme too, eliminating split-tone screens.
- `render_game_to_text` now reports the active surface as `archive-light` or `machine-dark`. Focused SAR/VR verification passes 5 files / 87 tests and the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules. The required web-game client was attempted but still cannot import `playwright`; no screenshot claim is made for this pass.

2026-09-02 — SAR moonstone aether archive art direction
- Rejected the ordinary paper-library treatment and established a single magic-future thesis: otherworld sorcery has become engineered infrastructure. The archive now uses a moonstone-white atmospheric field, spectral violet/cyan coordinate lines, cut-corner translucent memory slabs, soul-index beacons, and restrained magenta seal accents rather than beige paper, generic borders, or cyberpunk neon.
- Rebuilt the first viewport around an animated coordinate spell at the right of the archive title. Cabinet ownership is a pair of aether manifolds, the character rail is a soul-link index, the selected owner becomes a stable-coordinate panel, User collections become memory crystals, character notes become private echoes, and empty shelves expose a dormant summoning circle.
- Carried the same system through the complete identity dossier and note reader: identity crystal, steel seal, User mask, worldline, timeline nodes, scene-00 panel, and primary actions now read as related arcane instruments. The forge is the dark inverse of the same palette, with an orbiting compiler ring and violet/cyan module energy instead of the previous generic laboratory surface.
- Added only three motion families—coordinate orbit, magic-heart pulse, and crystal reveal—with reduced-motion behavior retained. `render_game_to_text` identifies the visual system as `moonstone-aether-archive`. Focused verification passes cleanly in single-thread mode (5 files / 87 tests), Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules, and temporary output was removed. The required web-game client still cannot import `playwright`, so no automated screenshot claim is made.

2026-09-02 — SAR 柜子视觉收敛与铸造页复原
- Removed the moonstone pass from the forge route entirely. The assembly screen is back on its existing dark machine styling and original cabinet header contract; the new visual layer is scoped only to archive-paper surfaces.
- Simplified the cabinet into a quiet future-magic archive: a cool flat moonstone field, one static coordinate seal, restrained violet/cyan index accents, ordinary character shelves, and lightly cut keepsake volumes. Removed the continuous orbit/pulse/reveal motions, backdrop blur, oversized glow fields, layered gradients, and animated empty-state spell circles from the cabinet route.
- Updated `render_game_to_text` to report `restrained-moonstone-archive`. Focused verification passes 5 files / 87 tests, the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,176 modules, and temporary build output was removed. The required web-game client was attempted but still cannot import its standalone `playwright` dependency, so no post-change screenshot claim is made.

2026-09-03 — SAR 模块商店、每日五件与模块袋
- Added the complete fixed 46-module catalog supplied for SAR, including plain descriptions, optional Caian commentary, external-effect examples, planned ticket prices, category metadata, User-target compatibility, and configuration flags. The activity-space `模块购买` facility is now live and opens a CSS-built counter without requiring any new item art.
- The market persists five random daily arrivals and three additional manual rack rolls. The local calendar day rebuilds only the market and restores all three rolls; purchased inventory and history survive. A roll never clears the module bag, and duplicate purchases stack as consumable copies.
- Implemented the first purchase slice only: module detail, conditional Caian guide, no-NPC plain-information fallback, trial receipt, persistent module bag, and a clearly labelled unlimited trial-allocation mode while fishing currency is unfinished. Purchasing never auto-loads a character and does not yet touch Chat/Date context.
- The visual system treats the shop as a temporary SAR counter: map remains behind the full-screen overlay, while CSS sigils, serial numbers, restrained category color, two-column mobile shelving, one detail drawer, and one short receipt motion provide the merchandise layer. Reduced-motion disables all entrance transitions.
- Focused tests pass 2 files / 10 tests with cache disabled. An isolated Vite production bundle succeeds with 6,178 modules; full TypeScript reports only pre-existing unrelated repository errors and none in the new shop files. In-app browser QA at 430×900 exercised activity-room entry, five daily offers, Caian detail, trial purchase, bag persistence, and one roll from 3/3 to 2/3 with no new runtime errors. The required standalone web-game client was attempted but still cannot import its installed `playwright` dependency.
- Next slice: character selection and the load animation, then the structured 10-turn character / 5-turn User runtime with 3-turn expiry stabilization. Keep the current shop purchase and bag state as the source of consumable module copies.

2026-09-03 — SAR 模块装载、双向运行时与真言保护
- Completed the full module path from the persistent module bag through character selection, confirmation, approach/chip-loading motion, inventory consumption, and a visible installed-state receipt. Eligible targets are characters currently connected to Kanata; active or stabilizing module state is shown directly on each target.
- Added one shared persisted runtime for Chat and Date: character modules last 10 successful fresh LLM turns, User modules last 5, failed calls and rerolls never spend a turn, and expiry is followed by one explicit release reaction plus two stabilizing turns to prevent output inertia. A new installation cannot silently overwrite an already active User module.
- Added symmetric User targeting behind an explicit default-off `允许角色对我使用模块` setting. A character browsing the SAR module shop may choose and load one compatible module in the same autonomous activity call; a bounded manual reverse encounter is also possible while both parties are in SAR, with an on-map approach/loading notice.
- Isolated truth from performance with a single structured model envelope. Canonical Char/User meaning is stored as the real message and is the only version exposed to context building, Memory Palace recall, archive, relationship inference, and summaries; temporary distorted wording lives only in message metadata with an explicit non-factual annotation. Arbitrary Date input is rewritten whole rather than parsed locally.
- Chat preserves every custom bubble and adds only a small module light point that toggles the canonical line. Date highlights affected text itself and supports the same truth reveal in reading and visual modes. Commands, cards, actions, intent, facts, and relationship changes always execute from canonical output.
- Focused verification passes 5 files / 108 tests with cache disabled. The complete assertion suite previously passed 4,525 tests (the normal cache writer is locked on this Windows dev session), an isolated Vite production bundle succeeds with 6,179 modules, and mobile in-app QA covered purchase, bag, target selection, install animation, receipt, inventory decrement, and active 10-turn state with no application console errors. Full TypeScript still reports unrelated repository baseline errors, with none in this slice's touched files.

2026-09-03 — 彼方全区域抓取角色装载模块
- Corrected the module interaction direction. Buying remains exclusive to the SAR counter, but applying a purchased module now starts from the character: enter any Kanata room, tap the full chibi target, choose `抓住 TA · 使用模块`, then select a module from the bag. The character does not need to move to SAR, so the same path works while reading, dancing, exercising, or visiting any other room.
- Added a target-locked field-loadout surface that keeps the captured chibi visible, shows its current room/module state, exposes only the User's module bag, skips the redundant character picker, confirms replacement when needed, plays the existing approach/chip animation, and returns directly to the original room with `放回现场`.
- Made the complete chibi hit area keyboard/touch actionable with a stable accessible name, rather than relying on a small image hit target. The counter guide now explains the buy-in-SAR / use-anywhere division.
- Verified the full live path in the in-app browser: library chibi → character detail → capture → bag → module detail → target-locked confirmation → replacement/load animation → inventory consumption → return to the same room. Focused runtime/shop/VR tests pass 3 files / 70 tests, the isolated production build succeeds with 6,179 modules, and no new TypeScript errors appear in the touched files.

2026-09-03 — SAR Chat 气泡对齐、模块在场感与特殊模式兼容
- Replaced ordinal CHAR_SURFACE assignment with final-bubble-aware alignment. Standalone parenthesized action/narration bubbles never receive surface metadata and never consume the following polluted line, whether the model copied or omitted the action in CHAR_SURFACE.
- Strengthened the high-recency module contract from a writing-style instruction into a perceivable Kanata device. The first affected reply must notice the mismatch and react; later replies retain who installed it and include a personality-consistent awareness/coping cue without repeating mechanical exposition.
- Made built-in translation blocks atomic: one `<翻译><原文>/<译文>` pair maps to one persisted bilingual bubble, and the SAR envelope now explicitly owns the outer structure when both modes are enabled. Original and translated halves must carry the same distorted meaning. Custom same-bubble formats such as `日文（中文翻译）` remain intact and are not classified as action-only.
- Kept `<语音>` plus `<字幕>` atomic and required both CHAR fields to preserve their markup. Chat TTS now speaks the module surface while canonical `content` remains the only memory/summary truth; voice-only and foreign-voice bubbles retain the small truth toggle, whose transcript view can reveal canonical wording without changing the historically spoken audio.
- Focused verification passes 5 files / 80 tests, the isolated Vite production build succeeds with 6,179 modules, and filtered TypeScript reports no errors in the changed files. The temporary build directory was removed.

2026-09-06 — 彼方水域、本地布告板与信号活动封存
- Current request: continue the existing branch/context; implement fishing + a market scoped to each user's own characters and occasional local NPCs, move the ended Signal Fall event to page 3 “往期活动”. Fish artwork must be CSS/code-native, no AI image generation; dinosaur artwork will be supplied later.
- Visual thesis: muted waterside blue-green, a single circular fishing workspace, CSS fish silhouettes and warm-paper market notices. Motion is limited to the fishing ring, fish fins/hover, and brief catch/detail reveals; reduced-motion supported. Used frontend-skill and develop-web-game.
- Implemented nine CSS fish, weather-linked weighted catches with real-perception provenance/fallback, circular hold/release fishing with easy mode/fullscreen/retry, catalogue, quality-based daily sale prices, relic display/study and six-hour egg hatching. Twelve dinosaur/relic IDs have replaceable placeholders.
- Added separate wallets, deterministic per-world daily prices, 0-coin/imaginary listings, item/favor/tip requests, comments, local NPC visits, exact asset/money settlement and complete owner archives on completion/removal/24-hour expiry. Fresh-state mutations and receipt synchronization use separate Web Locks; no market backend or cross-user publication.
- Character fishing and market visits each use one normal model call (existing transport retries unchanged). The code fixes catch facts and validates transactions; the same response selects keep/release/guestbook/private-chat/market. Both transaction parties receive deduplicated vr_card facts plus exact quoted words, separate from subjective claims. Private shares and complete event details now render in chat cards.
- Backups include the complete market; corrupted raw fishing storage is exportable for recovery. Existing unrelated module-context edits were preserved, and water-specific prompt additions are scoped to water/market sessions only.
- Moved Signal entry to page 3, reduced banner size, removed admin resume button. Worker rejects archived event writes before D1 access; memorial GET only SELECTs existing records, preserving unfinished poems and original booklet sizes. Old creation/seed/append code removed and post-office bundle regenerated. No online deployment or remote deletion performed.
- Verification: 50 new fishing/market/character-session/Worker assertions pass; combined prior run of SAR/Chat/Date/VR and new tests passed 186 assertions (187 after the added real-weather case). Full run: 4,589 pass and 2 pre-existing amsgInstantChat.wiring source-anchor failures, confirmed already mismatched in HEAD. Full TypeScript has only existing errors after fixing the new lock callback typing. Isolated production build succeeds (6,186 modules).
- Resolved the skill client dependency issue using bundled Playwright plus existing Edge and a scoped ESM loader. Cached the project's existing Tailwind CDN script for offline test styling. Ran the official web-game client and inspected screenshots/state. Additional mobile QA passes catch/cancel/escape/fullscreen/catalogue/0-price listing/comment/archive/buy/tip/reload at 390px and 320px. Real OS/Music Provider integration passes page 1 → SAR → water → page 3 → read-only memorial; no application page errors or real LLM requests.
- QA scripts/fixtures and detailed boundaries are documented in apps/vrWorld/FISHING.md. Screenshots/cache/build output are under ignored output/fishing-qa and output/fishing-build. Remaining user-supplied input: dinosaur images. Worker freeze takes effect online only after deployment; module-shop paid-currency integration deliberately remains off.

2026-09-06 — Separate SAR water and noticeboard entrances
- User correction: water and noticeboard are two entrances. Split the SAR facilities into parallel 水域 / 布告板 buttons, retaining existing CSS artwork, palette and restrained interaction motion.
- Each entrance now has its own title, two-item navigation and character activity control; board opens on prices without loading weather. Shared wallet/inventory/price persistence and character activity logic remain unchanged. Listing from a catch transitions to the board; both close back to SAR.
- Verified direct board entry, water-to-listing transition, return paths and shared-state preservation at 390px / 320px with both mobile and real-provider integration scripts; no page errors. Ran the official web-game client, inspected game state and screenshots of both entries, water, board and small-screen layouts. Focused tests pass 4 files / 98 assertions, and isolated Vite build succeeds (6,186 modules). No new TypeScript diagnostics in this slice's changed components. No prompt/economy/Worker logic changed in this correction; no deployment performed.

2026-09-09 — Mobile dinosaur cafe art prototype
- User asks for mobile-first, simple rounded 3D toy dinosaurs based on their pastel reference, with a cozy cafe sandbox. Art approval comes before complete fishing/gameplay integration. Previous SAR diorama was removed at user request and stays removed.
- Isolated in `.worktrees/dino-cafe-art`, branch `codex/dino-cafe-art`, based on `codex/kanata-update`; root checkout belongs to other ongoing work.
- Created five offline generated, continuous-surface GLB dinosaur models and a standalone Three.js cafe preview at `/prototypes/dino-cafe/index.html` (Vite port 5182). Four default residents, close-up view, touch orbit/zoom, tap placement, rotate, greeting, reset. No fishing inventory/economy changes.
- Mobile rendering limits: DPR 1.4, 30 fps animation cap, static 1024 shadow map, cafe geometry batched with vertex colors. Five models total 985 KiB / 6.7–8.7k triangles each / one draw per model. Default four-resident cafe: 49,872 triangles and 18 draw calls in steady frames. Real device performance not yet measured.
- Inspected actual 390px, 320px, landscape, desktop, placement, and all five portrait renders with the image viewer. Fixed sliced framing, lumpy curve silhouettes, overlapping residents, excessive draw calls, hidden placement feedback, and landscape action clipping. Continuous bodies are sculpted offline with curved fields and simplified before GLB export.
- Official game skill Playwright client completed without errors. Supplementary mobile QA passes placement/rejection/cancel, rotation, greeting, reset, touch orbit, pinch zoom, all model portraits and viewport layout checks. TypeScript scope and isolated production build pass. Build reports the expected large Three.js entry chunk (218 KB gzip).
- Next: get user feedback on this art preview before integrating collection counts, saved layouts, furniture collisions, routes, and cafe-specific antics. See prototypes/dino-cafe/README.md for commands, budgets, boundaries and gameplay direction. No deployment or main-game integration in this art round.

2026-09-09 — Shared clay dinosaur gardens, painting and hidden grid
- User replaced cafe with a sandbox, excluded battles, requested per-individual colours, then corrected material to clay/playdough. Later refinements: smaller dinosaurs, all characters share multiple maps with six residents per map, a hidden fixed grid for touch and LLM positioning, much more differentiated cute scenery.
- Implemented twelve clay GLBs with separate vertex-colour weights for body/detail paint; kept the mobile renderer and reduced scene scale from .72 to .49. Replaced cafe UI with garden / collection and per-toy name, paint, original/current stage, origins and visit history.
- Added grassland, crescent-shell coast and volcanic expedition layouts. After user rejected recycled bridge/fence assets, split scenic compositions: only grassland uses the stream/bridge/bunting; coast has lighthouse/palms/umbrella/starfish/sailboat; volcano has lava forks/crystals/rock columns/supplies. Each map persists independently; one toy occupies one map.
- Shared hidden board: 30 stable cells, eight headings, six residents per map regardless of owner. Touch positions snap; model chooses a cell or semantic near/face anchor. Availability, props, revisions, fixed state and map are checked at application time. White landing dots show only while placing.
- Integrated SAR entrance and fishing-collection return. First actual garden grants one deduplicated gift; demo has clearly labelled samples. Same fishing storage and backup preserve individual origins/paint/names/story through map moves and gifts. Legacy free-placement preview migrates to cells; malformed storage is never overwritten.
- Real character visits use the existing persona/API/session pipeline, one action with exact quoted words and factual receipts. User originals remain immutable; signed continuations and reversible visit changes append history. Online scheduler has frequency limits. Closed-app background visits are NOT implemented and UI/docs say so.
- Verified 52 focused assertions, including real session pipeline with fake API. Fixed Web Lock callback rejection recovery (sync throws could leave the Node lock blocked); browser writes and next operations now complete after invalid actions. Mobile QA passes touch grid movement/rotation, scene switching, paint/cancel/reload, stage/visit/undo, collection portraits and 390/320/landscape. Real OS/Music Provider SAR → garden → fishing → garden passes without live model requests. Full Vite app build succeeded; whole-repo TypeScript has pre-existing diagnostics, with targeted changed-file diagnostics checked separately.
- All work remains in codex/dino-cafe-art worktree. Root checkout untouched; no deployment, merge or commit. Details and reproduction: apps/vrWorld/DINOSAUR-GARDEN.md, prototypes/dino-cafe/README.md.
- Final differentiated-scene pass: coast has no bridge, fence or bunting; volcanic lava now connects down the mountain. Fixed landscape landmarks share positions with collision checks, so touch placement, props, character actions and legacy migration cannot intersect the umbrella/lighthouse/sailboat. Added one regression, bringing focused tests to 53 passing. Re-ran official game client, visually inspected all three scenes, and exercised touch placement/restore on coast and volcano as well as grassland. Mobile QA has no console errors. Full app production build passed after the scenery rewrite; final prototype build also passed after landmark occupancy fix. Existing whole-repo TypeScript errors remain outside this change. Real-device frame-rate measurement and closed-app background visits remain follow-up work.

2026-09-09 — SAR room artwork, cast and temporary portrait layout editor
- Connected the user's room image, original-pixel red/common and green/fishing foot mask, five extracted facility points and extra dinosaur entrance on the coffee table. NPCs and visitors share deterministic collision-separated placements; overflow uses the roster. Facilities retain their real VRWorldApp callbacks.
- Copied the two supplied chibis as original 472-square canvases. Corrected an initial transparent-margin crop that enlarged NPCs: they now share visitor base dimensions and foot alignment. Existing visitor custom transforms remain supported.
- Registered 13 GitHub SAR standing portraits through the existing CdnImg mirror chain, with expression fallback and last-ready retention. Room uses local chibis only; dialogues display both smaller standing portraits with cinematic black bars and an opaque, dimmed inactive speaker. Existing Caian script preserved; added fixed Aiven fishing/garden guidance.
- User wants to calibrate overlapping portraits themselves. Added a temporary editor at `/prototypes/sar-art/index.html?edit=portraits`, with separate scale/x/y sliders, front/back order, actual dialogue preview, browser-local autosave, copyable parameters, reset and mobile collapse. Initial editor draft is 112% of previous portrait sizes. Await user's final layout; do not promote their draft to production defaults until they finish. Read parameters from its visible textarea or `sar-art:portrait-layout-draft:v1` in the same browser.
- Focused tests: 19 pass. Mobile/integrated artwork QA passes all 13 expressions, 6 facilities, alignment and SAR → dialogue → actual garden. Editor slider/overlap/persistence/reset/390/320 and identical default chibi width checks pass. Inspected desktop/mobile screenshots with the image viewer. Production Vite build passes (6,216 modules). Targeted TypeScript only reports the existing two `utils/apiCallLog.ts:708` role diagnostics.
- Official game client run in restricted network correctly displayed image retry placeholders; repeated with public-network access to verify actual remote assets. See output/sar-art-qa/official-network for the final result. Artwork docs: apps/vrWorld/SAR-ART.md. Still only codex/dino-cafe-art worktree; no merge, commit or deployment.
- User finalized portrait layout: both scale 150, Caian x 27 / Aiven x 75, y 0, front auto. Promoted to production defaults. Choices now float at the center of the dialogue viewport, outside the fixed 164px portrait-mode dialogue box; long dialogue scrolls inside and resets to top on the next line. Geometry checks verify no stage/cast/dialogue movement when lines or choices change.
- Further user correction on resizing: replaced width-based, bottom-anchored portrait scaling with height-based sizing and each original image's aspect ratio. At approved 150%, portrait height is stage height minus 24px and top anchors to the headroom line; scaling extends downwards. Same-height width changes preserve size; landscape shrinks to its available stage height without clipping heads. Inspected 390/320 and landscape renders; QA adds explicit headroom and width-resize assertions. Editor still exists, but the user's layout is now the formal default.
- Final geometry QA passes including 24px headroom at all tested sizes, width-only resizing without character growth, centered choices outside dialogue, and fixed frames across long/short lines. Official client captured both real remote portraits and choices successfully (output/sar-art-qa/official-headroom), no console errors; inspected its screenshot. Final production build succeeds with 6,217 modules. No deployment or commit.

2026-09-09 — SAR per-line emotional performance
- User asks for a richer performance across the entire introduction, including Caian becoming embarrassed immediately when Aiven undercuts him. Replaced coarse per-node expression defaults with 98 individually directed lines using all seven Caian expressions, plus 19 explicit listener reactions. Existing dialogue words, branch conditions and completion flags are preserved.
- Added typed `SARCastExpressions` to each line and renderer. Resolve full cast snapshots after condition filtering, preserving reactions inside each node and resetting at the next node. Aiven's punchlines affect listening Caian on the same beat; the following defensive response stays embarrassed. Curiosity, enthusiastic explanations, awkward recovery and Aster recollections have distinct expressions; Aiven listens with interest/sadness or softens into a smile where appropriate.
- Six focused story tests pass, including eight punchline/reply pairs, condition branches, non-mutating snapshots and node reset. Targeted TypeScript still has only the two existing apiCallLog.ts:708 diagnostics. Production build passes (6,217 modules). Mobile/provider QA passes actual listener-image switching, Aster's paired emotions, all prior layout checks and integration; inspected the resulting images.
- Browser QA first reloaded during a simultaneous full build, so repeated successfully after build completion. Run production builds and browser QA sequentially because generated HTML can trigger Vite reloads. Official skill client rerun uses output/sar-art-qa/official-expressions. Root checkout unchanged; no commit/merge/deployment.

2026-09-09 — Distinguish villainess and tsundere module prompts
- User clarified 恶役大小姐 as Japanese 悪役令嬢 / お嬢様口調 (〜ですわ) and wants separation from 傲娇. Added model-only `promptRules` to module definitions. Villainess now emphasizes poised confidence, ornate politeness and natural Japanese endings; tsundere emphasizes awkward denial and embarrassment. Both respect existing language/translation settings, canonical intent and original character identity.
- Updated the two shop descriptions and villainess example. Rules explicitly distinguish their added stylistic features, keep each effect scoped to its corresponding user's/character's surface field, and do not invent hidden romantic intentions or aristocratic backstory. Titles/IDs, duration, inventory and prices are unchanged.
- `activeLine` resolves detailed rules from the current catalog so already-installed snapshots receive the fix without save mutation or reinstallation; expired effects do not reinject rules. Existing modules without detailed rules retain the previous path.
- Runtime/shop regression checks pass 23 tests, including old installed state, active/afterglow behavior, different simultaneous character/user effects and unaffected unrelated modules. Full production build passes (6,217 modules). No live LLM generation/evaluation was invoked; verification covers prompt assembly and existing contracts. Worktree only, no commit/merge/deployment.
- User clarified the intended sound is Japanese-villainess translation style in Chinese, with the actual language always following the character's settings. Updated the prompt, label and shop example accordingly: Chinese remains Chinese and uses elegant, haughty translated-anime phrasing; ですわ is a style reference, not a suffix to paste into Chinese. Native Japanese endings apply only to Japanese-speaking characters, and other languages/translation formats retain their own language. Re-ran the 23 runtime/shop checks after this text-only clarification; all pass.

## 2026-09-10 · Dinosaur backyard interaction and product UI
- User accepted a garden-first backyard direction and explicitly asked for simple, guided product UI. Keep each map at six dinosaurs; replace the action/target form with one optional sentence.
- Visual thesis: a quiet cream-and-sage clay toy garden, with the whole group as the main view. Content: garden first, three bottom entrances (decorate / dinosaurs / visits), contextual dinosaur sheet, optional first-use guide. Motion: local prop docking and distinct activities, small greeting/ambient cues, quick sheet entry; reduced motion stays still.
- Added shared spatial activities (tent nap, picnic snack, flower hide/sniff, puddle/coast splash, tree leaves, stump lookout), open tent geometry and three walkable props. Local animations share facts with character visits, preserve grid coordinates and user text, respect fixed toys and neighbours, pause offscreen, and use no LLM calls per frame.
- Added concise property-use labels, contextual placement guidance and one-tap named interaction spots. Kept ownership, paint, gifting, catalog, event replies/undo and old save compatibility. First entry no longer opens a permanent selected-dinosaur tray.
- First QA: 59 focused tests passed after correcting a negative walking bob that could sink a fixed toy into the floor. Official game client ran and its screenshot/state were inspected. Mobile QA verified all twelve models, touch picking/orbit, sentence save, paint save/cancel, fixed position, real prop activity, visit/undo, and 320/390/landscape layouts. Additional final checks in progress.
- Final validation: 60 focused tests passed. Added delayed sentence-only character result coverage across map switches. Updated mobile QA also passed named quick-placement, stump animation, and reduced-motion stability. Real OS/SAR → garden → fishing collection → garden integration passed without minting another starter or losing data.
- Inspected the final 390 px garden, resident sheet, single-sentence editor, placement strip, furniture menu, stump interaction, 320 px sheet, and landscape screenshots. Production build passed (6,218 modules). Focused TypeScript still reports only the two pre-existing utils/apiCallLog.ts:708 role union errors; no new type diagnostics. No actual-phone performance or live-LLM evaluation claimed.
- Intentionally limited to local movement between a saved cell and its nearby prop, not general autonomous roaming; no offline visits or hand-painted textures added. This turn is local/uncommitted. Earlier requested Caian greeting change remains intact.

## 2026-09-10 · Explicit placement and stationary play
- User rejected instant writes, text destinations and drifting animations. Replaced them with local placement drafts for both new/existing props and dinosaurs. Grid preview, emissive highlight, direction arrow, invalid reasons, rotation, Cancel and explicit Confirm. Final mutation rechecks revision/map/ownership/capacity/collision; cancel produces no events or phantom props. Prop removal now has an inline confirmation.
- Clickable prop meshes, paw markers with touch tolerance, illustrated prop palette, contextual “让恐龙来玩” selecting a collection toy and previewing a viable interaction cell. Decorations no longer pretend to have supported play actions.
- Saved x/z/facing remain authoritative in every frame. Head/tail/feet morphs preserve one body draw call; visible cookie/crumbs, foot splashes/ripples, flower/leaf sway, sleeping breathing and static stump support. No roaming or calendar-driven animation. Existing identity, words, paint, visits, 6-per-map and old saves preserved.
- Initial 67 focused tests pass. Updated full mobile browser QA passes draft/cancel/invalid/confirm/new-prop identity, scene picking, stationary anchors, saved refresh, 12 species, 3 maps, visits/undo, and 320/390/844 layouts. Inspected menu, dino/prop preview, scene affordance sheet, landscape preview screenshots. Fixed inherited button grid-area overlap discovered by real clicking and improved sparse flower mesh hit targets. Final integration/build/official client checks follow.
- Final validation: full mobile QA reran successfully after touch-target and landscape control polish; official web-game client completed and its final screenshot was inspected. Real SAR / fishing collection round-trip passed with the same starter and unchanged saved garden. Production build passed with 6,221 modules in 33.48 s. TypeScript has only the two pre-existing apiCallLog.ts:708 role errors. Root checkout remains clean. Changes remain local in codex/dino-cafe-art; no commit/push/deploy.

## 2026-09-10 · Fix “让恐龙来玩” dead ends
- Reproduced original stumps with zero valid grid interaction poses; also found the old planner collapsed occupancy/capacity/static-collectible failures into a generic nearby-space message. Added one shared play planner for the collection and scene, searching all eight facings and checking actual activity assignment.
- A free legacy prop with no usable spot now offers an explicit paired prop/dinosaur preview. It highlights both and commits both atomically only on confirmation. Cancel writes nothing; no other dinosaur or prop moves. Availability/reasons appear before selection. Preview now includes static perch support height.
- 72 focused tests pass, including every default interactive prop across all maps, original stump regression, paired identity/preview/cancel/stale revision, occupied/static/full cases. Mobile browser regression passed selecting the old stump, paired cancel and confirm, reload retention and unchanged neighbours. Inspected play list, paired preview, perched dinosaur and official client screenshots. Final build check follows.
- Final: full mobile QA reran successfully with the perch-height assertion; latest paired preview and official-client screenshots inspected. Production build passed (6,221 modules, 57.21 s); TypeScript retains only the two known apiCallLog.ts:708 errors. No commit or push.


2026-09-10 — Garden rendering and SAR user guide
- Confirmed real integration is lazy-loaded from VRWorldApp, with the SAR coffee-table and fishing collection entrances; current new edits remain local in codex/dino-cafe-art.
- Added docs/sar-user-guide.md, verified against current handlers: NPC scripts vs real character turns, all SAR facility flows, recent 10 garden facts vs absent lifetime statistics, events/undo, normal 1-generation visits vs conditional memory overhead, simulation 1 forge + up to 50 turns, reverse-module local vs LLM paths, existing development-mode economy switches.
- Renderer now pauses hidden catalog and static portraits/placement/reduced-motion scenes, wakes for controls/paint/preferences, caps drawing pixels at 1M, and refreshes animated shadows at 3 Hz. Incremental props reuse geometry, species morphs are prepared once, particles use one instanced draw per active dinosaur, and disposal explicitly releases the context.
- Actual screenshot inspection caught transparent instanced prop rings obscuring terrain even though functional tests passed. Kept individual ground circles; rechecked terrain in the official client's screenshot. No diagnostic wireframe or temporary renderer globals remain.
- Performance QA: same four-dino 390x844/DPR2 view went from 59/74 calls to 44/59; static/hidden sampling adds 0 frames, terrain/prop builds stay 1/9 after a prop rotation, templates stay 4 across repeated portraits, GPU geometry/texture counts stable, 1920x1080 drawing buffer 998898 pixels.
- Real integration QA passed: SAR entry, starter, fishing collection, return/save continuity, mobile widths 390/320; both created WebGL contexts explicitly lost on exit. Focused typecheck still reports only the two pre-existing utils/apiCallLog.ts:708 role union errors.
- Final validation: 72/72 focused tests, full product browser regression, performance regression and real-entry/context-disposal regression passed. Final official screenshot and mobile stump/coast screenshots visually checked. Production build passed (6221 modules, 54.27s). Main E:/NMJ/SullyOS checkout remains clean; no commit or push performed.

2026-09-10 — SAR fishing ownership and personal unlocks
- Simplified character fishing to one JSON generation: keep/release + reaction + optional ordinary DM. Market decisions remain in the bulletin-board visit.
- Added persisted pending trips, ownership reservation, replay-safe settlement, per-character lifetime acquisition history, conservative legacy reconstruction, and clay release rejection.
- Added local public guestbook first-species announcements (user confirmed local all-character scope), event receipts, retriable delivery outbox, atomic deduped chat writes and atomic shared board appends.
- Current verification: 52 fishing tests passed; 19 garden behavior/placement/activity and 57 VR baseline tests passed; 2 real DB delivery/concurrency tests passed after guarding the optional browser event in Node. Browser acceptance and final build in progress.
- Existing unrelated anniversary/theme edits in the shared worktree were left alone. No commit or push requested this turn.

2026-09-10 — SAR fishing completed validation
- User clarified Caian/Aiven remain fixed-script NPCs; fixture characters were renamed 阿岚/小舟. No NPC autonomy added.
- Final focused fishing + real IndexedDB concurrency/durability coverage: 58 tests passing; related garden/VR suites: 90 passing (148 total).
- Real UI/DB acceptance at 390/320 passed with mocked model responses: 5 catches, 6 attempted generations including one deliberately failed request, 2 personal unlocks, 2 public announcements. Delivery-only retry adds zero calls. Real guestbook renderer and ordinary text-message persistence verified.
- Inspected final release/share panel, 320px acquisition-count/date catalog, public announcements, and official web-game client canvas screenshot. Console errors were only the intentionally injected HTTP 503 and its expected caught API error.
- Production build passed in 37.41s. Feature TS check reports only 8 pre-existing diagnostics in apiCallLog, builtinSullyLive2D, memoryPalace/pipeline and qixiMemoryBundle; no diagnostics in the changed feature.
- Updated docs/sar-user-guide.md. All work remains local on codex/dino-cafe-art; no commit/push this turn.

2026-09-10 — SAR formal simulation offline only
- Removed online/offline controls; new forge openings and runtime turns use in-person speech/actions. Legacy communications and archive metadata retained without reinterpreting historical facts.
- Updated user guide. 18 simulation tests pass; real cabinet browser QA at 390/320 checks continuation, one mocked model call, legacy archive, theme, reload and sealing. Official client screenshot and 320px screenshot inspected.
- Scoped TypeScript check: 5 existing diagnostics in apiCallLog, memoryPalace/pipeline and qixiMemoryBundle; none in this change. No commit/push.
- Next user request: inspect internal market and add manual-only Kanata participation, preserving existing scheduled users.

2026-09-10 — Manual Kanata participation, grouped pagination, and market check
- Added persisted manual/scheduled participation. New joins default manual; legacy enabled users keep scheduled behavior. UI offers both modes, schedules only automatic users, removes stale plans, and permits explicit invitations.
- Chat framing keeps manual participants aware of Kanata without fabricating autonomous outings. Session writes preserve the newest participation flags, so an in-flight response cannot undo a switch to manual/off.
- Access list filters by existing character groups, mounts at most five character rows per page, and resets page on group changes. Verified 8/4-member groups, disjoint pages and 320px layout.
- Browser acceptance through real OS providers and SAR entry passed: stale automatic trigger produces zero model calls; explicit invitation produces one; in-flight toggle and refresh preserve manual; board tip pays once and a stale repeat cannot pay again. Model calls were mocked; no user API calls or production data were used. Mobile/manual, pagination, market and official client screenshots inspected.
- Updated docs/sar-user-guide.md with manual access and honest board boundaries (no escrow; private share still lives inside activity card; bounded model view).
- Final branch checks: 219 tests across 22 suites passed, including SAR/garden/fishing/market, chat prompts and anniversary changes; production build passed (37.82s on the previous pass, final pagination build also successful). Scoped TypeScript has the same 8 pre-existing diagnostics, no new feature errors.
- User requested committing/pushing the entire current branch. Include all current product/source/assets/docs/tests; exclude generated output/. Remote codex/dino-cafe-art fetched and matched local HEAD before committing.

2026-09-10 — Quiet bulletin-board pages
- User request: simplify the cluttered board UI and move operations into subpages.
- Visual thesis: warm paper, dark ink, one muted green action; a readable board with generous space.
- Content plan: one combined note feed and one write action; detail/publish pages; quotes, history and invitations under More.
- Interaction thesis: short page entrance, subtle note hover, preserved reading position; respect reduced motion.
- Implemented page hierarchy and explicit pay/receive button labels. Preserve the existing ledger and real/text item rules. Browser verification pending.
- Final validation: market browser regression passes transactions, all four publish paths, exact/stale specimens, aliases, scroll restoration, Escape/cancel, collection-to-publish round trip, archives and reload at 320/390/1024 px. Real SAR entry regression passes. Zero browser page errors; no real model calls or user data used.
- Official web-game client ran after layout changes; inspected current screenshots and text state. Production build passed (16.28 s). Full TypeScript still reports unrelated pre-existing errors; none in FishingMarketOverlay.
- New screenshot gallery: output/fishing-qa/board-clean/gallery.html, with nine current screens and a link to the earlier screenshots. Verified every image loads and all gallery navigation works.
- UI work complete; no commit or push. The earlier discussion of character cancellation/retry/settlement boundaries remains separate from this presentation change.

2026-09-10 — World will and simulation reading surfaces
- User authorized the narrative principles discussed above and simultaneous UI refinement.
- Visual thesis: a quiet book-like reading surface, warm paper/dark ink, one muted green accent; story takes the screen.
- Content plan: readable scene and character text first; opening preview and one start/continue action; identities/background/details on demand. No permanent crisis dashboard or spoiler panel.
- Interaction thesis: gentle message arrival, unobtrusive new-message affordance while rereading, short subpage transitions; reduced-motion support.
- Narrative work: replace coercive forge/runtime/phase instructions; distinguish story time from turn budget; allow quiet narration; persist bounded director facts in the same response, with no extra model calls.
- Implemented shared narrative principles for forge and runtime, quieter phase guidance, optional narration, and bounded director facts persisted with assistant messages. Reject malformed structured output without spending a turn; preserve legacy plain text and previous valid continuity. Director facts stay out of the reader and exported archive.
- Rebuilt identity previews and simulation reading pages in warm paper/ink with a persisted dark theme. Move progress, background, settings and early seal into a details page; hide spoilers and duplicate headers. New replies respect rereading position. Ordinary return pauses; sealing explains that it ends the run.
- Validation: 22 narrative/simulation unit tests passed. Browser regression passed quiet replies, private continuity across reload, legacy replies, malformed JSON/retry, rereading scroll, theme persistence, archive download, early seal, and the final 50th interaction at 320/390/1100 px. All model replies were mocked in isolated fixture storage; zero real model calls and zero browser page errors.
- Official web-game client rerun shows the actual reader with matching sar-simulation text state. Inspected mobile card/reading/detail/archive screenshots and desktop reading. Final production build passed (31.47 s); full TypeScript has existing unrelated diagnostics, with none in this feature on the scoped check. git diff --check passed.
- Screenshot gallery: output/fishing-qa/sar-reader/gallery.html. Ten images, page navigation and overview verified. User-facing gallery contains static screenshots only and does not seed user storage.
- Implementation and UI pass complete. Real-model narrative quality still needs a live reading session; mock tests verify the protocol and UI, not the model's long-term storytelling compliance. No commit or push performed.

2026-09-10 — Refine the story composer
- User request: make the sending field feel more considered and less dated.
- Visual thesis: one quiet ivory writing surface with an integrated, muted green send action.
- Content plan: text first, one short placeholder, one send button; no extra tools or helper copy.
- Interaction thesis: focus gently reveals the boundary; text grows within a bounded height; the send button gains color when ready and responds subtly to hover/press, respecting reduced motion.
- Replaced separate textarea box and round paper-plane button with a unified writing bar, borderless auto-growing text and an inset arrow key. Kept a 44 px send target and Chinese composition-safe keyboard handling. New-content control follows the actual composer height.
- Browser regression passed auto-grow/clear, long draft scrolling, same-width viewport shrink, whitespace disabled state, Chinese IME confirmation, Shift+Enter newline and Enter send, plus all prior reader/retry/archive checks. Found and fixed draft overflow becoming hidden when only viewport height shrinks.
- Inspected idle, writing, dark, long-draft and 320 px screenshots. Official skill client rerun and text state verified; no browser errors or real model calls. Final production build passed (15.50 s), git diff --check clean.
- Updated the existing reader screenshots and added a six-view comparison gallery at output/fishing-qa/sar-reader/composer-gallery.html; every image and navigation verified. No commit or push.
- Follow-up: vertically centered the send button inside the writing bar, including multi-line drafts. Refreshed the gallery screenshots, reran browser checks and the official client, and inspected the centered two-line input.

2026-09-10 — Connect SAR purchases to the shared game wallet
- User request: end unlimited gacha and free module claiming now that the feature is ready. Found hard-coded development flags in both screens and unused shop credits.
- Asked about currency/pricing while auditing storage; after the optional response window proceeded with stated defaults: shared existing 鳞币, one free draw per pool per local day, then 30 coins, catalog module prices unchanged. No real-money integration or model calls.
- Atomic commerce stores paid inventory and wallet in one fishing-market write, serialized with existing market mutations and Web Locks where available. Stable request IDs prevent duplicate charges. Stale free quotes do not silently become paid; each mutation reads current wallet, offers and inventory. Storage failure does not publish a grant.
- Existing inventories migrate once without retroactive fees; canonical reads and backups preserve the migrated record. Removed paid-inventory truncation, kept legacy credits as unused history, and made helper storage errors explicit. Corrupt wallet data remains exportable as raw backup.
- UI shows balance, exact cost, insufficient balance and saved receipts; refreshes across pages. Module use reads fresh inventory before applying a module so stale UI cannot clone a consumed item.
- Validation so far: 78 focused unit tests pass, including 12 commerce cases; browser payments pass double click, free/paid draws, buy/reload, closing before reveal, shared wallet updates, insufficient balance and quota failure at 390/320 px. Scoped TypeScript has no changed-feature diagnostics; full project still has unrelated existing errors.
- Final validation: 79 focused tests pass (13 commerce cases, including partial legacy restore after migration). Browser also verified two pages racing for the final 30 coins, and buying then installing on a real fixture character: exactly one inventory unit consumed, no second charge, persisted runtime active. Official client screenshot/text state inspected; no browser page errors or real model calls.
- Added an eight-screen gallery at output/fishing-qa/sar-commerce/gallery.html; images and navigation verified. Production build passed. No commit/push or live user-store edits; all browser checks used isolated fixture contexts.

2026-09-10 — SAR room, personal warehouse and economy
- Visual thesis: a continuous light surface from Kanata header to the illustrated SAR room, with quiet moss-green controls.
- Content plan: two top-right game buttons, NPC settings and a personal warehouse; balances and inventory live inside the warehouse with an owner selector.
- Interaction thesis: tactile icon presses, short sheet entrance and inventory selection; keyboard focus, back/escape and reduced-motion support.
- Economy plan: new wallets 120, two free daily draws then 30, modules 18–34, lower fish valuations and 180 daily system buyback per actor. Preserve legacy money/items. Character spending must use its own wallet and owned inventory.

- User refined navigation during implementation: SAR belongs beside World as a primary entry and opens as an independent full-screen room. Removed the nested World page, global header/tabs and SAR pagination; added return to Kanata. World now has rooms + archives, with its archive return corrected. Settings/warehouse remain inside SAR.

- Completed: independent SAR primary entrance beside World, full-screen light room, return to Kanata, settings/warehouse tools, and World archive navigation. Settings reuse the NPC preference; warehouse switches all characters with actual ownership, statuses, filters, details and active effect display.
- Economy implemented: new wallets 120; common fish bases 8–12, all bases 8–90, ±10% daily variation, quality 1/1.15/1.3; per-actor system buyback 180 per local day; incoming wallet cap 999,999 while legacy balances/assets are preserved. Refused income leaves the item intact.
- Character module purchases now choose browse/buy using their own wallet, 60 daily purchase budget and 30 reserve. Owned units are reused and actually consumed for user effects; reverse install cannot generate a free unit. Model-only claims do not grant items.
- Validation: 116 focused unit tests passed, including 13 new economy/ownership tests and a 366-day all-species/all-quality bound. Real provider browser checks passed for 320/390/1100 px, NPC persistence, full-screen entrance/return, archives, independent wallets/bags, cross-tab updates, empty states, focus/escape and four mocked character shop sessions. Existing commerce and Kanata integration also passed; zero page errors or real model calls.
- Official game client rerun after the navigation change; current screenshot and text state inspected (tab=sar). Final production build passed in 31.75 s; git diff --check clean. Earlier scoped TypeScript check had no changed-feature errors, while the full project retains unrelated diagnostics.
- New gallery: output/fishing-qa/sar-hub/gallery.html, eleven screenshots including primary entrance, full-screen room, NPC settings and user/character warehouse. Every image and gallery navigation verified. docs/sar-economy.md records the numerical plan and sampled valuation ranges; user/implementation docs updated.
- No commit, push, live payment integration or live user-store changes performed. Runtime effect persistence still follows the existing OS profile storage lifecycle; the economic atomic guarantee covers wallet plus purchased inventory, not an IndexedDB/localStorage cross-store install transaction.


2026-09-10 — Collection atlas and Kanata titles
- User requests: warehouse atlas for fish/dinosaurs/chips/modules with per-owner progress; distinguish facility controls from character names; optional custom titles above characters, names below, and titles known/editable during the actor's own Kanata activities.
- Visual thesis: retain the light moss/ivory warehouse; atlas enters from one small header button, with four progress rows and category pages. Facilities use solid green plaques/icons, character names use quiet foot labels, titles use a small warm accent above the avatar.
- Content plan: current inventory remains separate from distinct historical collection; preserve legacy items in a small collection journal before consumption, with no duplicate-copy inflation. Title editing lives with the selected owner in the warehouse.
- Interaction thesis: bounded atlas pages/search/status filtering and nested back navigation; deliberate title save/cancel; skip motion under reduced motion. Title updates share the existing activity model response and protect intervening user edits with a revision.

- Completed: warehouse atlas with four category totals (9/12/49/46), personal historical collection/current quantities, search/status filtering/pagination/detail views and nested keyboard/system back. Legacy module ownership is journaled before final-unit consumption, persisted with the market and backup. No historical dates or temporary-chip ownership invented.
- Completed: facility green icon plaques, quiet foot names, optional warm head titles, label-aware placement and title offsets for enlarged chibis. Warehouse supports self/character title edits, 12 Unicode characters, save/cancel/clear. Existing enable settings are preserved.
- Completed: current title in ordinary chat and all Kanata activity prompts. Optional XML/JSON self-title metadata stripped before original parsers; successful activities apply guarded changes only to their actor. Empty/malformed activities do not rename; manual edits, edit-and-revert revisions and disabling participation defeat stale updates. Optional title-save failure does not misreport a committed activity as failed. Scheduled fire-pack templates omit a potentially stale title.
- Validation: 143 focused unit tests passed across 14 files, including 15 new collection/title tests. Existing full-provider SAR hub check passed; new 320/390/1100 browser checks passed with zero page errors and six mocked model activities (XML edit, JSON edit, malformed activity rejection, in-flight manual priority, title-only rejection, clear). Manual title persistence/clear, owner isolation, last-unit consumption, missing/search/pagination, nested focus/back and phone label collision checks passed. No real model calls or live user storage modifications.
- Final production build passed in 31.00 s. Full TypeScript check still has pre-existing errors in MemoryPalaceApp, CompanionHome, old output audit/tests and Vite config; no diagnostics in this feature's source or tests. git diff --check passed.
- Official game client ran; screenshot and state show tab=sar. Its unmocked initial world screen reports blocked pre-existing remote room thumbnails (jsDelivr and fallback hosts, ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED); traced independently. SAR art and the feature UI use local assets and render correctly. Dedicated feature browser checks mock external requests.
- Delivered gallery: output/fishing-qa/sar-collection/gallery.html, 15 verified images with phone/desktop layouts, room labels, title editor, four atlas categories and a consumed module still collected. Opened via Codex browser panel (queued). No commit or push.

- User visual correction: dislikes green specifically on facility entrances. Changed board/modules/chips/gacha/fishing/garden plaques to warm ivory with coffee text, tan markers and a fine wooden-tone edge. Preserved icon/shape distinction from character labels. Re-captured all 15 gallery views; full collection/title browser verification still passed. The 31 s production build above precedes this final CSS palette adjustment; no logic changed.


2026-09-11 — Hide SAR room overlays
- User asks for a toggle beside settings that hides character names, titles and facility controls together.
- Visual thesis: keep the room illustration and avatars in place; one eye button reveals or removes the room labels, with the existing warm ivory facilities unchanged.
- Content plan: a third compact top-right tool, hidden-state recovery always available; names, titles, markers, NPC exclamation and occupant roster disappear together.
- Interaction thesis: instant reversible toggle without avatar repositioning; preserve preference across reload and retain the existing pressed-button feedback. Hidden facility controls are removed from pointer/keyboard interaction.

- Implemented persisted labelsHidden preference in SAR club state, Eye/EyeSlash control beside settings, and CSS hiding for room labels, title text, facility/nav markers, NPC quest badge, roster and text-only avatar initials. Avatars and positions remain stable; visible top controls remain available. Compact header spacing supports 320 px.
- Verified both real-provider browser suites: toggle/hide/show, keyboard activation, hidden facility non-interactivity, visible avatars/unchanged feet, settings access, persistence in both directions after reload, 320 px header fit, existing atlas/title and six mocked activity sessions, and existing hub economic flows. Zero page errors in isolated suites. Six SAR club unit tests passed. Production build passed in 1m 1s.
- Updated gallery with two hide-state screenshots (17 total). No live model calls, production user-store edits, commit or push.

2026-09-11 — Aiven special dinosaur model
- Visual thesis: the existing soft clay material carries an impossible dinosaur silhouette, with a purple T. rex torso, warm pink long neck, pale yellow horns and powder-blue paired plates. Content: one collectible model plus its collection silhouette; no new room UI. Interaction: reuse garden orbit, paint and gentle greeting morphs.
- Added a reproducible --only=aiven-chimera model target, unique catalog/icon and matching long-neck motion pivot. No fishing pool, pricing or reward logic changes in this visual task. Browser model verification pending.
- Visual validation complete: aiven-chimera.glb has 8,236 triangles, one mesh/draw and 307,840 bytes. Dedicated memory-only fixture and test cover complete finite geometry, body/accent/fixed paint channels, 320/390/1100 px, portrait/garden modes, recolouring, orbit, greeting and reduced motion. All 6 screenshots inspected; no browser errors. Official game client rerun clean after adding a fixture favicon; final canvas/state inspected. Existing dinosaur garden/play/placement/activities tests: 33 passed.
- Integration handoff: DINO_CATALOG/dinoDefinition/defaultDinoPaint, DinoIcon and /dino-models/aiven-chimera.glb are ready. Root handles event-only species lookup, granting/collecting and story reveal. The model does not enter the random fishing pool.


## 2026-09-11 — SAR 个人线

2026-09-11 — SAR NPC roster
- Visual thesis: a warm-white mobile character archive, using existing emotional portraits as the dominant art and restrained sand/gold accents. Content: Collection/Roster navigation, two residents, five-star progress, full supplied profiles, and replay records grouped by events/topics/easter eggs. Interaction: simple NPC/content switching, folding rank lists, and replay through the root callback; reduced motion omits entry transitions.
- Roster is global user progress, independent of the warehouse owner selector. Only completed scenes are replayable, locked labels omit scene titles and four/five-star stories remain unopened. Collection back chain and focus restoration wired; scoped browser validation in progress.
- Roster verified: dedicated browser tests pass full supplied profiles, local portraits, 5-star display, completed-only callbacks, locked title secrecy, global owner independence, storage broadcast refresh, zero-progress state and 320/390/1100 px. Screenshots inspected; trimmed no hair from the portrait frame. Official game client final screenshot/state inspected with mode=sar-familiarity-roster and no errors.
- Real root smoke passes SAR NPC Caian C1-01 and Aiven A1-02, completion into the roster, same-day no repeat, root replay callback, unchanged replay progress/rewards/inventory and back to roster/collection/warehouse. No model calls or page errors. Existing collection+titles full browser regression also passes. Full tsc retains baseline errors elsewhere; no diagnostics in SARFamiliarityRoster, SARCollectionView or new fixtures.
- Reported to root for consideration: on a 390x844 phone, the dialog stage leaves Aiven's third response below the initial viewport; it remains reachable by scrolling. No dialog/root edits made by this subtask.

2026-09-11 — SAR souvenir backup audit
- Full ZIP is covered by the existing v3 pipeline: collectSARLocalBackup is nested in backupData.sarLocalState, metadata serialization runs collectBlobRefs over the entire JSON (including pending and souvenir photo/member chibi tokens), writeBlobsToZip includes each token binary, and restoreBlobsFromZip restores original token IDs before restoreSARLocalBackup writes the references. No token rewrite is needed. DB.importFullData does not clear blob_assets; GC and token dedupe both enumerate all localStorage values.
- Fixed one text_only omission in OSContext: sarLocalState now passes through the existing recursive stripBase64, so this media-free export cannot retain dead photo/member blobref pointers or embedded images. Actual production strip function and assignment were extracted/transpiled and executed against nested pending photo, membership, souvenir photo and legacy data:image; every image was removed while progress, flags, names, positions/scales, coupons and original live data remained intact. Report: output/fishing-qa/npc-lines/text-only-sar-strip.json.
- Existing regression suites passed: fishingMarket34, dinosaurGarden14, sarCollection7, fishBackup2, sarEconomy13 (includes warehouse), backupFormat22, backupRoundtrip19 = 111 tests. No assertions were changed. The existing atlas-total assertion currently passes because the extra chimera and hidden egg cancel; notified root to add identity/egg unlock cases instead of relying on the fixed count.

- 截图：output/sar-room-layers；纯 CSS 调整，无需新增单测或改版本号。无待处理项。

### 2026-09-11 SAR 四档隐藏与钓鱼整理
- 视觉方向：青绿水面占主画面，保留简短天气/模式/抛竿和结果；说明进问号，角色邀请折叠。交互保留水纹、钓获浮现与模式切换，避免堆叠长说明。
- SAR 隐藏循环：名字称号 → 全文字 → 全角色小人（设施标记恢复）→ 恢复；旧 labelsHidden 档兼容映射第二档。

- 官方游戏客户端水面截图/state 已检查，无错误；完整 tsc 诊断与先前基线逐字相同，本次文件无新增诊断。截图目录 output/fishing-refresh，开发服务仍为 127.0.0.1:5173。
- 本轮无待处理实现项。

2026-09-11 — SAR conversation rules and shared presentation
- Removed the invented activity-room/fishing guide menus. Live headers show the NPC name; authored titles appear only in collection replay. Greetings and completed scenes exit directly; no farewell choice or immediate milestone button.
- Each NPC rolls at most one uncompleted current-tier topic per local day (80%). Aiven easters roll independently (20%), and conditional Sully encounters have a separate roll; simultaneous results wait for later clicks. Topic ten unlocks its milestone on the next visit.
- All interrupted scenes restart from the beginning with fresh choices, expressions and drafts. Reward-bearing nodes are staged for the current attempt; only complete scenes award progress and gifts atomically. Legacy receipts retain existing gifts and prevent duplicate grants.
- Initial meeting now shares the full-height cream stage and fixed bubble with daily dialogue. Choices follow the surrounding palette and keep their background on hover/focus; no purple selection state. Preserved central choices, cast continuity and the delayed embarrassed reaction.
- Verified 41 tests covering authored paths, independent rolls, daily limits, restart/stale advances, milestone timing, rewards, discounts and backup compatibility. Browser presentation suite passed 15 screenshots (320/390/1100 px); real-provider smoke and 23-scene interaction/keepsake suite passed with no page errors. TypeScript diagnostics exactly match the existing 10699-character baseline, with no new errors.
- User's main browser data was not seeded; all browser QA used isolated contexts. No commit, push or version bump.

2026-09-11 — SAR consistent portrait scale and unobstructed stage
- Removed the conversation header. Shared SARDialogueMeta places the current speaker, affinity stars, replay-only title and back button beside the dialogue. Kept the metadata outside the advance button so return and next remain separate accessible controls.
- Fixed the solo width constraint that made wide Caian art shrink after a two-person exchange. Solo/exchange now share identical stage-height sizing and native aspect ratios. Greetings use the same cast component, removing their separate 430px cap. Lowered both actors by 24px without resizing, naturally clipping the lower body at the dialogue edge.
- Reproduced two guest-flash cases with failing tests, then fixed both: opening transactions briefly exposed the previous guest before a restart; narration reused a departed guest as the visual speaker. Opening now gates intermediate storage snapshots; narration only retains a guest still staged for the exchange.
- 32 focused tests passed, including both new flicker regressions. Browser presentation suite passed 19 screenshots covering 320/390/1100 px, solo/exchange/solo image heights, both NPC greetings, metadata, replay, initial branches and the delayed embarrassed punchline. Standard skill browser client passed and final screenshots were visually inspected.

2026-09-11 — SAR two-person spacing adjustment
- Reduced both NPC portraits by 15% with the same scale in solo, greetings and exchanges. Removed the extra downward offset; the lower image edge stays anchored at the dialogue boundary so cropped-body artwork does not float.
- Kept the existing horizontal positions and staging logic; only shared portrait CSS changed.
- Verified 19 presentation screenshots and the standard game client; both layouts keep identical portrait scale, no page errors. Inspected the final phone exchange and desktop two-person screenshots.

2026-09-11 — SAR fixed backdrop, local settings, install clearance and roster
- Added SARDialogueBackdrop and shared the live room framing in sar-club-room.css. Initial meetings, normal dialogue and replay retain the full room image position/scale independently of the portrait stage.
- Moved SAR NPC preference and initial-meeting rewind out of the general participation page into Activity Room settings. Rewind confirmation now renders above settings, receives/restores focus, and has priority for back/Escape. Existing preference and intro state are reused.
- Raised module installation actions with 64px plus bottom safe area; buttons are at least 44px tall and icons/text are centered. Caian's roster portrait now uses normal.
- Browser QA passed: exact live/dialogue image geometry within 0.02px at 320/390/740/1100px, initial meeting, NPC preference persistence, rewind cancel/confirm, roster local normal.webp, and participation separation. Commerce suite passed including install button clearance at 390x844, 320x568 and 740x390. Dialogue suite passed all 19 screenshots; official game client screenshot and state inspected. No page errors.
- Full tsc output exactly matches the existing 10699-character baseline, no new diagnostics. No commit/push/version change; isolated browser contexts only.
- User raised output robustness while continuing to describe desired behavior. Interpreted as model-output format tolerance and graceful recovery; no new parser behavior has been changed in this pass. Await the rest of their examples/scope.

2026-09-11 — SAR module sticker alignment and adjacent output audit
- Reproduced the exact reported 11-bubble envelope: canonical normalized the historical sticker tag, surface did not, so the sticker text consumed bubble 10's surface slot and the last rewritten sentence was never attached. Both sides now use normalizeAiContent before parsing.
- Extended the audit with failing tests for copied HTML and five-field historical share cards, plus inline control tokens. Surface now excludes these with shared pure extractors; disabled-HTML placeholders do not consume speech slots. No surface directives or stickers execute or create duplicate messages.
- Unified full-width colon/lowercase SEND_EMOJI and named-sender history tags in assistantActionFormat, removing the duplicate reverse-tag normalizer. Verified omitted, missing, repeated and mixed-format stickers, quotations, omitted actions, bilingual/voice atomic blocks and final speech.
- 83 tests passed across post-processing, SAR runtime, request prompts and action normalization. Isolated browser fixture uses the real MessageItem and DB: 11 messages, sticker at 9, all 9 surface/truth switches correct, final sentences intact at 390/320px and after reload, no page errors or model calls. Existing saved user messages were not modified.
- Full tsc diagnostics for this change match the existing 10699-character baseline with no added errors. No commit, push or version change.


## 2026-09-11 — SAR release, backup, analytics and desktop integration
- Request: audit SAR / anniversary / global chat input backup, add Umami, replace Amsg2/collaboration startup announcements with a richer SAR-led release, and expose Kanata on three desktops.
- Added three-page illustrated SAR announcement, v3.9 (SAR), in-app changelog, seen-state backup compatibility and one-shot launch into SAR. Removed Amsg2/collaboration from startup queue; historical docs remain.
- Fixed missing global chat input preferences and SAR local preferences in Settings export/import. Full exports now extract/restore nested legacy SAR photos as assets; existing v3 blob sidecar carries embedded references. Backup no longer refreshes/rerolls saved module shop offers while reading an older date.
- Added explicit SAR feature analytics whitelist plus anniversary open/apply/save results; eight enum-only session snapshot dimensions. Extended poison tests and analytics documentation. Local development remains excluded by the existing analytics gate.
- Desktop replacements: MobileGameHome Archives → Kanata (illustrated planet), TamagotchiHome Pixel → Kanata, CompanionHome Music → Kanata.
- Actual isolated OSProvider exportSystem/importSystem roundtrip passed all three modes. Full mode compares gameplay/unfinished drafts/reward receipts/garden/inventory/runtime/message metadata/anniversary themes and decoded photo bytes. Text mode retains progress/preferences while removing custom photos; media-only does not reset gameplay/preferences.
- Unit regression: 43 files / 523 cases, initially 521 pass with two stale 1000-coin expectations in fishingSession. Updated expectations to current SAR_STARTING_BALANCE without changing product balances; rerun of fishingSession + chat input/auto-reply passes 36/36. Analytics/privacy checks pass 100/100.
- Browser: 320/390/1100 announcement pages, old queue suppression, actual FAQ/SAR CTA dispatch; SAR room/dialogue background/settings/rewind/install/roster checks pass. Existing skill game client passes initial dialogue. Screenshots/reports under output/sar-release*, output/sar-desktop-entry and output/sar-room-polish.
- pnpm build succeeded. TypeScript report output/sar-release-tsc.log exactly matches prior 10699-character baseline: no new diagnostics; unrelated existing errors remain.
- No user browser data was modified; all seed/import tests use isolated browser contexts.

2026-09-11 — Module display and lifecycle follow-up
- Replaced the glowing dot/hidden paragraph taps with labeled SAR speech switches. Date reading/GAL state is independent; repeat lines and original-text resume snapshots resolve by batch position.
- Added global draggable/collapsible module monitor listing every character and the user. Early end starts three recovery reminders and persists endReason; same-run/same-phase reply guards prevent stale requests restoring effects or consuming the first end notice. Enum-only Umami end event.
- Verified 49 postprocessing, 20 runtime, 12 payload, 5 backup, 6 presentation, 28 Date regression, 3 analytics tests; isolated real-store Chat and Date browser scripts passed at 320/390 px, no model calls or page errors. Production build passed. Typecheck retains pre-existing errors; no new module diagnostics.
- Next user steering: simple fishing should have shadows/casting/empty outcomes, paginate and group cabinet and warehouse, vary daily greeting expressions, and introduce every facility with NPC-led first-visit help.

2026-09-11 — Facility guides, paged collections and simple fishing
- Redesigned the cabinet as a compact per-character library. Character group/search plus eight avatars per page; six records/notes per page, selected character survives view changes. Character-owned notes are read only for the selected owner, replacing the all-character DB fan-out.
- Warehouse now shows twelve item types per page, resets scrolling and selection when paging/filtering, and labels the user owner simply 我.
- Simple fishing now has a swimming shadow, forgiving cast target, animated bobber/wait/reel phases and an empty outcome. Only successful completed catches enter inventory; failed saves can retry without duplicating catches. Manual play remains available.
- Added question-mark help to all seven facilities, with expanded first-visit NPC introductions: Aiven for fishing/dinosaurs, Caian for the other facilities. Seen flags join SAR backup/restore. Daily greeting expressions vary by sentence while authored scene expressions remain intact.
- Validation: 11 files / 101 related tests passed. Real components + OSProvider + isolated DB browser fixture passed with sixty custom characters: eight visible avatars, six records, twelve warehouse entries, lazy notes, restored selection, both daily greeting expression sequences, seven guides and caught/empty inventory checks. No model calls or page errors. Inspected phone/320px/forge/guide/fishing screenshots. Official game client completed three snapshots with no errors; final caught state and screenshot inspected.
- Production build passed; git diff --check passed (line-ending warnings only). Final typecheck diagnostics match the existing 10699-character baseline; no new errors. All user profile data stayed untouched. No commit or push.
- Final robustness follow-up: selected-owner note read failures now render a distinct error with retry instead of an empty-cabinet state; stale requests cannot replace the current result. The isolated browser suite passed injected read failure -> visible alert -> retry -> recovery, and its final screenshot was inspected.
- Final production rebuild passed after the note-read retry fix (56.12s); final TypeScript diagnostics exactly match the 10699-character baseline.

2026-09-11 — Dinosaur wording cleanup
- Unified the four remaining legacy dinosaur labels to 橡皮泥恐龙 across Caian topic/title dialogue and Aiven catch/record narration. Repository-wide source/copy scan found no remaining old dinosaur wording; diff whitespace check passed. Copy-only change, no gameplay or version changes.

2026-09-11 — Warehouse pagination visibility
- Moved warehouse paging above the item grid and kept it sticky while scrolling. Shows filtered record count, twelve entries per page and page index; a non-empty single page keeps disabled navigation visible. Owner and category changes still reset the page.
- Verified an isolated real-store fixture with sixty-six entries: twelve rendered per page, six-page navigation including the final six entries, sticky mobile controls, owner/filter resets, empty state and 320px layout. Standard game client also passed; mobile/desktop/sticky screenshots and state inspected, no page errors. Shared pager defaults remain unchanged for other facilities.

2026-09-11 — master alignment and final SAR fixes
- Checkpoint b87f5f97 preserves all branch changes before merging origin/master (27987fbb). Resolved nine conflicts, retaining master context/history cleanup, worker updates and this branch's SAR, chat controls, anniversary and backups. Master was fetched again at completion and is unchanged.
- Fixed the announcement portrait overlap on 320px/390px screens. Version is v3.10 (SAR), following master's v3.9.2.
- Split SAR/chat-input preferences into the fifth mutually exclusive analytics snapshot slot; preserve old event payload limits and exactly one cold-start snapshot. Nine SAR fields now include the explicit board model permission.
- Corrected Instant Push route selection: SAR's local route also runs local emotion evaluation; frozen config, reply locks and delivery semantics are preserved.
- Gacha rendering: extracted static styles, memoized artwork, paged eight modules, eliminated animated filters, paused covered/background animation, and ignored identical market snapshots. Isolated comparison: 25 -> 8 mounted cards; 567 -> 201 collection DOM nodes; 20 unchanged refreshes caused 20 -> 0 React commits; help overlay running animations 8 -> 0. Both pools, capsule/reveal/detail, wallet, duplicate clicks, cross-tab race and storage failure were checked.
- Module monitor now lists active effects only. Ending all modules hides it, including after reload, while the afterglow/next-reply release instructions persist. A new installation makes it reappear. Real OS + Date browser regression passed.
- Board now has manual refresh for two or three local NPCs, or a roaming character ONLY after an explicit SAR setting permits models. Default/invalid/missing settings disable all board model generation; manual invitation and the session runner have the same gate. Removed old half-hour visitor pulse. Existing posts, comments, inventories and finite wallets are retained. Permission is in SAR backup and fixed-enum analytics.
- Validation: full 426-file / 5,061-case suite run; the final parallel run had six timeout/cascading-lock failures in three heavy suites, all 91 cases passed when rerun with one worker. Earlier merge source-guard failures were fixed and their seven-suite / 147-case follow-up passed. New/affected board, runtime, backup and analytics tests: 120 passed. Release UI (320/390/1100), full/text/media export-import, merged real Chat settings, seven facility guides, 60-character cabinet, warehouse pages, fishing, board opt-in and global module monitor browser checks passed. Standard game client captured the actual gacha capsule and matching state with no browser error report.
- Final pnpm build passed. TypeScript diagnostics match the pre-merge baseline exactly after normalizing line numbers (10,699-character baseline); no new diagnostics.
- All work is local on codex/dino-cafe-art; no push or publication to master has been performed.

2026-09-11 — board refresh / specified-character clarification
- Removed the redundant board-specific model switch, permission gate, backup preference and analytics field. Random character visits now reuse Kanata's existing free-roaming participation setting; specified-character invitations reuse the established manual activity pipeline, including manual-only characters.
- Exposed "指定角色" beside "刷新" on the board. Its existing selection page returns directly to the board when entered there. Added an immediate shared guard for refresh/invite double clicks.
- Updated guide copy and regressions. 97 targeted tests passed. Isolated browser checks verified NPC and roaming-character refreshes, explicit invitation of a manual-only character, duplicate-click protection, direct return navigation, 320px layout and absence of the extra permission setting. Standard client state and screenshots also verified.
- Production build passed (1m 12s).

2026-09-11 — collection names, Aiven fish sales and exclusive keepsakes (in progress)
- Collection owner labels now resolve current profile names; old fish/dinosaur owner snapshots no longer leak user IDs. Fish catalog, live renames and dinosaur origin/detail browser checks passed.
- Added sell disposition + optional saleWords to the same character fishing response. Actual daily price, quality premium, shared daily buyback quota and wallet bounds are verified atomically. Saved Aiven reply/expression and payment survive delivery retries and SAR backup; user fish detail and character activity/chat cards show the receipt. Five authored replies use local assets without a model call.
- Added Collection -> Exclusive keepsakes shelf over existing earned souvenirs and story-only dinosaur collection history. NPC filters, twelve/page, original photo replay and no reward replay. Fixed focus loss after filtering so Escape returns properly.
- Relevant suite: 9 files / 100 tests passed; name, fish-sale, keepsakes browser scripts passed. Standard client captured collection navigation and state with no errors. TypeScript diagnostic output matches pre-existing baseline exactly (10,699 bytes). Build not yet run for these changes.
- Latest user asks to greatly refine Caian artifacts visually. Current next work: redesign membership/admin cards, meeting record, photo presentation and memory card plus collection previews; preserve original saved photo geometry, identity snapshots, progress and reward logic.
- Art direction: Caian's carefully filed keepsakes; ivory paper, deep ink and a restrained brass accent. Content: a dominant physical object, then its original note and provenance, then return. Interaction: brief object entrance, photo front/back reveal, subtle card lift on pointer devices; respect reduced motion.
- Concurrent changes in components/os/AnniversaryGiftPopup.tsx, utils/anniversaryGifts.ts and docs/anniversary-gifts.md are not ours; preserve and exclude from our commit.

- 用户纠正演出方向：保持完整立绘＋对话，物品只在真正拿出时进入前景，下一句收起；使用逐节点 authored effectLine，避免凯恩翻找卡片、艾文收线时提前泄露物品。保留收藏页实物样式。手机前景限制在立绘下半部，不移动房间和人物。
- 应用户要求，开发服务的名册临时开放两位 NPC 各三个星级事件；通过 DEV 门禁的内存预览运行交互，不修改实际进度或发奖，正式构建不开放。

- 验证：新增物品前景组件始终保留原立绘 DOM；凯恩翻找时不展示，实际拿出时显示，下一行收起，存档刷新不会重新出现；带选项的展示先收起再选择。320/390 手机截图、五种实物、证件确认、照片翻面与展开构图均检查。
- 六段开发预览经真实图鉴 → 名册入口完整读完（C1 21、C2 117、C3 106、A1 13、A2 26、A3 39 次操作），逐段比较存档完全相同；生产门禁通过 esbuild 置 DEV=false 实测仍锁定。

- 保留并排修改：周年庆三处文件，以及 AppErrorBoundary、preloadableLazy、chunkLoadRecovery 和对应测试；未将它们当成本次 SAR 修改覆盖。

- 最终全量 tsc 已结束：本次 SAR 文件无新增类型错误；原有基线错误仍在，另有并排修改的 utils/preloadableLazy.test.ts 中 caught 为 unknown（TS18046）。没有把全量类型检查记为通过。

- 本轮：证件清晰度、SAR 句末标点、凯恩三个星级事件的逐句表情重配，移除手动接入额外提示词并加入公共 SAR/两人介绍。视觉仍是立绘＋纸质道具，文字清晰优先；卡片正向排版，以卡片、身份信息、确认按钮为层次；保留轻淡入、合照翻面和构图展开，取消会模糊文本的旋转/整层滤镜。

- 本轮完成：凯恩七种、艾文六种表情按固定剧情逐句编排，六段星级事件逐句检查无连续超过三句同表情；长句支持 sentenceExpressions，存档与回顾保留末句表情，凯恩平常更多 normal，拆台后才 embarrassed。陈述句补齐句号，问号/感叹号/停顿与动作原样保留。
- 接入提示词：移除额外手动活动段落，统一加入 SAR 与两位管理员的公共介绍；不改手动/自动调度；公共介绍不虚构相识或星级私密经历。修正用户当前 SAR 房间名，钓鱼活动说明包含售鱼给艾文。
- 实物支持点击或放大按钮打开独立只读详情，完整查看与关闭不确认领取、不推进台词；Escape 只关详情并恢复焦点。证件取消整层滤镜与旋转，按钮保留在纸卡下方，放大入口放左侧避开脸部。
- 艾文礼炮参考周年开屏的全屏散落方式，改为 document.body Portal，56 片有限 CSS 粒子覆盖视口，不占物品窗口、不挡点击，减少动态效果时隐藏；离开礼炮节点清除。
- 验证：10 个相关测试文件先通过 81 项，补充表情/标点/公共介绍测试后相关两文件 22 项通过（合计 86 项）；物品放大/不误确认/焦点返回/全屏礼炮/节点清理浏览器检查通过；五种实物、证件确认、合照翻面和 320/390 布局回归通过；标准 web-game client 完成并检查截图。pnpm build 成功；全量 tsc 仍是既有错误与并行 preloadableLazy 测试错误，本轮文件无新增类型错误。

- 收藏图鉴主题修正：统一为随全局主色变化的浅底、正文、次要文字、分隔线和强调色；导航继承当前页背景，收藏、专属纪念、名册共用主题变量，消除绿底配棕色提示条的割裂。保留物品材质和角色原画颜色；只调整配色，原有切换/展开动画不变。

- 实际 320px 三标签来回切换、同一导航 DOM/唯一标题、纪念物查看与返回/分页/备份、名册档案/回顾入口/锁定/320/390/1100px 通过，游戏客户端截图已检查。

2026-09-12 — Aiven RPG fish-sales entry
- User correction: clicking Aiven starts normal dialogue immediately. Services appear only after greeting/story; star-event completion keeps a separate end page before services. Replay never offers selling. Weekday greeting comes first for Aiven.
- Verified browser greeting, after-dialogue sale payout, live star ending, replay, and 37 unit checks. Dinosaur GLB base-path hotfix separately deployed (PR 641).

2026-09-12 — SAR iOS safe-area fixes
- Module shop uses full chrome inset and a four-column header; garden keeps a full-bleed background with an inset control viewport. Standalone keepsakes, object inspector and facility guides respect the shared iOS fallback.
- Browser: 32 layouts plus keepsake checks across portrait/landscape/small/no-inset; exits, guide dialogs, tall inspector and content/header bounds passed. Official game client screenshot checked. Production Vite build passed (43.02s).

2026-09-12 — Kanata library categories
- Added searchable/category-filtered shelves, transactional category management and bulk moves, upload category defaults, and reading preferences reachable directly from the library.
- Category mode restricts rotation to selected categories (new books join automatically; empty/deleted categories do not fall back). Legacy per-book priorities and bookmarks/annotations preserved; background activity writes preserve latest reading preferences.
- 71 focused unit checks passed. Isolated browser verified grouping/import/persistence/backup/annotation preservation and 320px/390px/landscape safe areas. Production build passed; existing repository tsc errors remain, with no diagnostics in changed library files. Changes prepared for PR 644; do not merge without explicit authorization.

2026-09-12 — Grouped Kanata activity picker and automatic exclusions
- Manual invitation now has ordinary/SAR groups and all five implemented SAR subactivities, forwarded end-to-end through scheduler and OSContext. Module shop has its own activity prompt.
- Per-character advanced restrictions filter both automatic room and SAR pools; all blocked skips the model, manual invitations bypass only these restrictions, and current settings survive session writes. Existing random weights and garden preconditions preserved.
- 101 focused tests passed. Isolated browser verified every SAR route, exclusions persistence/inheritance/reset/backup, mobile safe areas, and real UI-to-session execution for module/cabinet with one mocked local model response each. Final production build checked before pushing. Keep PR 644 open pending explicit merge authorization.

2026-09-15 — Chibi room building: remove fixed entry parapet/posts; add reusable high/low/fence segments, adjustable length, replacement, removal and shared undo/redo. Verification in progress.
- Building verification complete: 16 model tests, Playwright add/type/length/rotate/drag/copy/remove/undo/redo/reload/category/mobile workflow, screenshots inspected, isolated chibi build passed. Original entry geometry removed (752 triangles). Fixed shell walls remain structural; construction is modular segments, not continuous drag drawing. No remaining blockers for this request.
- Perimeter update: wall/fence drag snaps to all four shell edges (x ±3.1 / z ±2.65), explicit edge buttons, building-only extended bounds. Exterior wall intervals are replaced by boundary segments and restored on move/removal. 18 model tests and all four edges / undo / redo / reload browser checks passed; screenshots inspected.

2026-09-15 — Petal sofa installed: cream/pink/lavender/yellow solid materials, lower frame and legs match table woodLight. Public GLB has 4,858 triangles, 92,460 bytes, no images/textures. External catalog assets normalized to furniture dimensions; exporter preserves them. Seating shelf added; only cushions recolor. Asset/browser QA passed (placement, rotation, undo, recolor, store/restore/reload), 18 room model tests passed, isolated production build and game client passed. Screenshots checked; sofa placed in live chibi preview. Automatic sitting remains future work.

2026-09-15 — Manual chibi sitting: user asked to try sitting now and make all future seating imports follow an optimization standard. Added one centered petal-sofa seat in normalized furniture coordinates, bent-leg sit pose and rigid short-hand placement. Calibrated seatOffset to -.03 using the actual seated lower surface (hip pivot height incorrectly buried the feet). Seat follows furniture transforms; changing action, storing/removing furniture or changing rooms releases it. 21 model checks plus real-body browser tests passed, including unchanged hand geometry/scale and cushion contact; game client actual seat click and production build passed, screenshots inspected. Current user's chibi left seated in a close view. Added docs/room3d-seating-assets.md and AGENTS navigation entry covering all file formats, no AI image textures, wood standard, geometry/material budgets, seat calibration and acceptance. Future work: autonomous approach/pathfinding, multiple residents and occupied-seat spacing; old chairs require individual calibration before enabling sitting.

2026-09-15 — Sofa sizes and anatomical correction: double widened to 3.70 with seats at x ±.94, z .55; matching 1.92 single has one seat/cushion. Retained arm/leg thickness and solid colors. Reproducible generator petal-variants.mjs uses checked-in texture-free source; double 4,858 triangles / 97,288 B, single 3,624 / 74,476 B, six materials each. Invalid old narrow-sofa placements relocate or store without losing identity/color. 23 model tests, both asset/color browser checks, single/left/right seating and two-body spacing checks passed; official game client and isolated production build passed; screenshots reviewed.
- User correction: feet are ONLY the tiny bottom tips, not the whole rounded lower body. Removed all hip/torso folding and the earlier broad forward shift. Only y ≤ .105, front-facing left/right toe regions extend slightly in z; y and the entire body above that region stay unchanged. seatOffset is now 0. Real-body regression checks enforce no torso/hand deformation and cushion contact. Current user's own chibi left in a close view sitting on the new single sofa, double next to it. Multi-resident occupancy/pathfinding remains future work; two children were rendered together in the verification fixture.

2026-09-15 — MMO-style seated emotes: separated posture (`standing`/`seated`) from motion, passed through visitor animation. Sitting uses idle action; wave-cute/wave-calm/sleep/angry/dance retain seat and foot contact. Seated cute wave keeps squeeze eyes and head tilt but no jump; seated sleep nods instead of lying sideways; angry/dance move head/hands without standing foot motion or body rotation. Added explicit stand button; seated idle labelled 坐好, sleep 打瞌睡. Browser QA passed six seated actions, actual hand movement with unchanged geometry, unchanged root position/rotation/scale, explicit standing, original standing hop/lying sleep, rotation/undo/storage/room cleanup; visual screenshots checked. Production build and game client passed. Seating docs updated.


2026-09-16 — Physical boundaries, room merge/split, and chibi door travel
- User request: three wall views (cutaway / dollhouse / hidden), real hidden perimeter boundaries including low walls/fences, remove/rebuild shared walls to merge/split adjacent room footprints, dedicated wide doors for chibi entry/exit.
- Added topology/layout/navigation/doorMeshes modules; optional boundaries stored with rooms, shared edits synchronized, existing saves default to four real walls. Windows use real available high-wall spans. Display preference is separate from physical layout/history.
- Composite placement crosses removed seams and migrates furniture plus supported props together. Complete partitions, including loose wall segments, split groups again; rebuilding through furniture is rejected. Door openings retain room identity, inherit on expansion, and allow collision-aware walking; exterior doors have landing platforms. Procedural solid-color hinged/arched/sliding doors, adjustable width/position, at least 1.8 units and current head clearance.
- Three views, wall editor, dedicated door category, floor-click walking and explicit entry/exit buttons wired into the existing preview. Existing creator remains on chibi-experiment.html. No texture generation, commit, deployment or user appearance edits.
- 48 focused unit tests passed. Browser topology QA passed views, real-body exterior entry/exit, adjacent arch passage, merge/split, undo/redo, furniture crossing, restore-wall collision and reload/mobile. Building QA passed prior segment editing and all four edges. Production experiment build passed with existing large-chunk advisory. Final sliding-door width/offset/open/return, real floor-click movement, official game-client screenshots/state and main preview save/reload checks all passed without browser errors. Fixed the preview favicon 404. Main preview now persists decoration separately under chibi-world-experiment-home; user storage was not modified by isolated browser checks.
- Scope: room enclosure follows original expansion-cell boundaries; arbitrary new polygons inside a cell, upstairs walking, autonomous activity selection and multi-resident occupancy remain future work.

2026-09-16 — Gaming furniture and chibi activity adaptation
- User supplied Meshy_AI_assets_20260916_025419.zip, then requested computer-chair gaming, maimai-style rhythm play, racing wheel and streaming. Nine inputs became 18 independent solid-color assets; authored short-back chair and eight-button rhythm cabinet bring the collection to 20. No AI images, texture baking or vertex-color sampling. Total 1,512,380 bytes / 39,209 triangles; all under 6,000 triangles and 200 KB each.
- Added offset/multiple support planes and reviewed contact footprints for monitor/lamp overhang. Presets are atomic independent furniture additions, preserve existing room contents, support undo/redo, and reject insufficient space. Gaming remains a theme filter alongside functional furniture categories.
- Added reviewed chair/device matching, head clearance and hand reach; 12-second manual computer/stream/race/rhythm activity rounds, rigid hand transforms, instance-scoped screen/button feedback and rotating wheel. Emotes retain seated posture; stopping, storage and invalid layouts release the activity. No real broadcasting, playable rhythm-game engine, autonomous approach or multi-resident occupancy implied.
- 48 pre-existing room checks and 11 new gaming checks passed. Browser asset/animation/stop/emote/storage/undo/resource-reuse/mobile preset checks passed without errors; screenshots viewed. Isolated production build passed with existing large-chunk advisory. Official game-client and final QA in progress.

- Follow-up steering: user requested a smaller/wider maimai silhouette and supplied a cat-ear gaming chair. Replaced the authored chair with reviewed 4,235-triangle user geometry, retaining high back/cat ears and adjusting the seated offset; rebuilt the rhythm machine as a squat rounded cabinet with eight broad rim keys and a lower control deck. Final 20-asset total: 1,646,812 bytes / 43,672 triangles, each < 200 KB / 6,000 triangles. 59 room/gaming unit checks passed after the replacement. Final browser/game-client checks ongoing.

- Final verification complete: revised cat-ear chair and squat round cabinet passed all four real-body activity workflows, rigid-hand geometry checks, timed/explicit stop, emote transitions, device storage/undo, stable GPU geometry/texture counts, mobile shelf and atomic preset undo/redo. All 59 focused tests passed; final isolated production build passed. Official game client successfully clicked streaming with the selected cat-ear chair; state confirms seated streaming, screenshots inspected, no captured browser errors. Final UI is in the existing experiment under 家具 → 电竞 and 小人 → 游戏时间; no changes to user appearance/storage, no new main-app entrance or deployment.

2026-09-16 — Lower monitor to seated chibi eye level
- User reported the display was too high. Shortened the support column and lowered all three screen panels by 0.42 world units without changing their proportions or base footprint; collision boxes use the same transform. Total monitor height is now about 0.998 instead of 1.418.
- Lower side screen exposed a real clash with the old streaming microphone placement. Added component-level boom collision bounds and moved the streaming preset's microphone forward; saved layouts migrate only the exact obsolete, colliding preset position, preserving IDs/color/support. Individually arranged microphones are untouched.
- 24 focused model/gaming tests passed, including saved-layout repair and idempotence. Real seated computer view inspected; official streaming-client verification in progress.
- Official game client confirmed the revised streaming preset starts seated streaming with no browser errors; final screenshot inspected. Screen now sits opposite the seated head, with the shorter mast still connected to its base. No further work pending for this height adjustment.

2026-09-16 — TV placement on turned cabinets
- Reproduced false '没有可用台面' on empty television cabinets rotated 90°/270°: automatic tabletop placement only attempted the object's world-zero orientation; at 180° it faced backward.
- findPlace now searches support-local centers and offsets, first matching the parent's rotation, including multi-height surfaces and offset contact footprints. Full geometry collision/overhang checks remain intact; no changes to saved layouts or furniture geometry.
- 29 focused model/gaming checks passed, with new four-direction TV add/restore/save coverage and undersized/full-support rejection. Browser and official game client verified shelf add onto the 90° cabinet; independent TV storage/restore, cabinet rotation/undo/redo and group restore passed without browser errors. Screenshot inspected.


2026-09-16 — Faithful twin rhythm cabinet and high jumps
- User supplied Meshy_AI_Pastel_Rhythm_Arcade_0916043612_texture.glb and requested the full maimai-like silhouette, allowing high jumps to hit buttons. Kept the provided twin cabinet, marquee, upper screens and control spine; removed all three AI image maps/UVs and rebuilt clean circular interfaces with hand-selected solid colors and geometric notes.
- Added left/right station selection, all eight button targets, whole-body hops with rigid unchanged hands, synchronized individual button feedback, sloping geometry collision slices and jump-path clearance including ceiling objects. Close-up framing accommodates high jumps, reduced-motion stays on the ground, and existing stop/emote/storage/reset flow is preserved.
- Output: 193,992 bytes / 5,940 triangles, 24 groups including sixteen separately animated keys. No new textures/lights; gaming collection totals 1,742,512 bytes / 45,876 triangles. Geometry-only source and reproducible generator retained. Unit target-contact/rotation/headroom tests pass; browser and final build verification ongoing.

- Final verification: 68 room/gaming unit checks passed (15 gaming plus 53 model/building/topology/wall/seating/watering). All four real-body activity workflows, mobile preset history, resource reuse, separate left/right apex/landing/stop and reduced-motion checks passed without browser errors. Official game client clicked the right station and captured active rhythm state. Screenshots inspected; isolated production build passed with the existing chunk-size advisory. No user storage changes, new app entrance, commit or deployment.


2026-09-16 — Larger rooms and visible neighboring rooms
- User requested default neighboring-room visibility for easier wall demolition and 1.5× rooms. Interpreted explicitly as horizontal length/depth ×1.5: 9.3 ×7.95, 2.25× floor area; wall height, furniture, residents and reviewed seat/hand interaction sizes unchanged.
- Centralized dimensions across boundary construction, room spacing, floor rendering, placement/support search, window mounting, resident spawn, watering/gaming clearance and walking. Added roomSizeVersion 2 migration: preserve ordinary furniture clusters and support IDs; move perimeter windows/walls and door offsets, extend perimeter wall coverage, avoid repeated scaling. Increased segment maximum to 10 for full new spans.
- Default rendering shows all same-floor room structures independently of physical connections, budgets distant furnishing detail, and keeps merged/walkable regions detailed. Building panel room chooser and direct shared-wall clicks preserve the world-space camera when switching edit ownership; adjacent-floor picking switches edit focus. No modifications to user storage during QA.
- 72 focused unit tests passed. Real-chibi topology browser checks passed doors, merge/split, cross-room furniture, undo/redo, reload/mobile. New layout checks passed default two rooms, camera continuity, wall picking and save. Screenshots inspected; final official-client/build checks in progress.
- Final verification complete: official game client clicked the shared-wall removal control and confirmed two visible tiles / one merged room group; screenshot inspected. Isolated production build passed with the existing large-chunk advisory. No outstanding work for this request.

2026-09-16 — Magnetic table/chair groups and bounded furnishing detail
- User requested Sims-like automatic table/chair matching, combined moving/rotation, and rendering optimization. Added reviewed computer-chair slots and generic table-side slots; a chair dropped within 0.65 units snaps only to an unoccupied, collision-free position. New chairs prefer free slots. Table movement/rotation carries docked chairs and tabletop support descendants; rotating a docked chair selects the table group. Drag away or disable snapping to detach.
- Persist dockId/dockSlot/dockDisabled independently of tabletop supportId. Validate saved relationships, adopt only already-exact legacy poses without moving items, and keep groups atomic across collisions, open room seams, storage/restore and history. Asset chairSlots extends matching to future tables without giving uncalibrated furniture new character actions.
- Large merged floors now retain the nearest furnishing budget plus resident/activity rooms, instead of rendering every connected room. All same-floor structures remain visible. Distant furniture is filled on entering/using its room. Freeze static child mesh local matrices while preserving animated nodes, index asset lookup, skip repeated quantized drag positions, and broad-phase collision pairs before detailed boxes.
- Verification complete: 79 focused unit tests; real-pointer docking/history/storage/detach/save QA; twelve connected furnished rooms with 3 detailed, 90 calls and 75,080 triangles; idle frame count stopped and resource counts stable after four room-switch cycles. Distant walking and activity correctly fill furniture without cancelling movement. All four real-chibi gaming workflows and topology/door browser checks passed without browser exceptions. Official game client captured grouped rotation preview; screenshots inspected. Isolated experiment build passed with existing large-chunk advisory. No user storage changes, commit or deployment.

2026-09-16 — Racing display and individual room finishes
- User requested a screen for the racing game and different floors/wallpapers in different rooms. Extended the existing gaming_racing asset with a fitted rear display/stand and a solid geometric road scene. Existing footprint, origin, wheel contacts and seat position are unchanged; display center is at the seated child's eye level. Same asset ID updates existing rigs, with added precise screen collision boxes. 159,948 bytes, 4,455 triangles, no image textures.
- Added per-room floorStyle/wallStyle enums, validation, saved styles and selectors in the room decoration panel, including a room switcher. Wood/tile/checker/plain floors and stripe/dot/paneled/plain wallpapers share existing room colors. Each inward wall face belongs to its room, allowing different finishes on shared walls; doors/arches retain openings, fences stay open, removed/hidden walls hide finishes. Merged rooms retain each original area's floor. Legacy defaults preserved.
- Mathematical material patterns add no textures, per-tile geometry or frame-time work. Material cache releases unused variants; rebuilt panel geometry is disposed. Custom floors hide the original wood surface and use a small decal depth offset to remove raster speckling; screenshots inspected for adjacent colors, archways, merge and mobile controls.
- 82 focused tests passed. Finishes browser checks passed room isolation, undo/redo, reload, shared arch, wall removal, hidden walls, mobile and stable geometry/material/texture counts over four style cycles; eco idle stops. Real-chibi computer/stream/race/rhythm contact, stop, emote, storage and resource reuse checks passed. Isolated experiment build passed with the existing chunk warning; no user storage changes, commit or deployment.

2026-09-16 — Phone capacity and rendering guardrails
- User proposed phone browsers limit each character to five rooms and fifteen furnishings per original room-sized area, asking whether that prevents lag. Added phone-only 5/15 placement checks; physical tile centers count each instance even across merged rooms or table/chair support groups. Stored objects and structural walls/doors do not consume furnishing slots. Desktop limits and data validation schema capacity remain compatible.
- Central commit and drag validation cover additions/copies/presets/restores/cross-room moves atomically; rejected edits keep original selection/panel/rotation preview and do not create history or save partial groups. Phone imports must fit. Existing over-limit saves load intact and allow non-increasing excess, recoloring and storage, with usage counts in relevant panels.
- Phone eco mode details one room rather than a forced three, while active visitor/activity areas stay pinned. Other same-floor structures remain visible; idle and hidden-page stop behavior retained. No runtime FPS guarantee: browser emulation measures render work, not actual handset thermals or GPU performance.
- Verification: 86 unit checks passed; phone-emulated 5-tile/75-chair fixture rendered one detailed tile at 100 calls / 79,236 triangles (no chibi in this stress fixture), idle stopped. UI checks passed sixth-room and sixteenth-piece rejection, storage/restore limits, undo/redo, legacy six-room preservation and cleanup. Build passed with existing large-chunk advisory. Screenshots inspected; user storage unchanged.

2026-09-16 — Gentle room lighting refinement
- User clarified they already use maximum desktop quality and requested a modest lighting improvement. Rebalanced the existing hemisphere/key/fill toward warm directional daylight with a cool front-side fill, keeping light count and exposure unchanged. Preserved chibi no-self-shadow and mild emissive treatment.
- Fixed shadow coverage still sized for the old smaller room. Active-room shadow bounds now cover the expanded tile; reduced normal bias strengthens furniture contact. Desktop clear uses 2048 maps, balanced/touch 1024; blur radius scales with resolution and old render targets are disposed on tier changes. Eco/overview still disable shadows; saved quality is not overridden.
- Before/after maximum-quality screenshots and real-chibi seating inspected. Browser verification covers quality switching/resource reuse and resident shadow treatment; isolated production build passed with existing chunk-size advisory. No new postprocess, AI images, or dynamic lights.

2026-09-16 — Exterior windows cast room daylight
- Added windowDaylight.js exterior-wall planner and windowDaylightLights.js fixed two-spot pool. Warm four-pane illumination reaches actual floors/furniture with cached occlusion; procedural 128px mask only, no AI image. Window glass gets a restrained warm emission.
- Source position/facing follows window drag/height/layout; furniture drags invalidate cached shadows. Storage, history, reload, active-room rebasing and detail selection remain synchronized. Hidden-wall display retains light; internal/shared walls do not create outdoor daylight.
- Desktop clear cap two; balanced/touch cap one; eco/overview off. Shared mask and 512px shadow targets reused, disposed on editor teardown; no continuous light animation.
- 28 targeted unit tests passed. window-daylight-qa.mjs passed actual drag, height, store/undo/redo, hidden-wall modes, tier changes, touch cap, reload and stable warmed GPU resource counts. Browser/shader errors empty. Official adapted game client screenshot plus furniture-occlusion screenshots visually checked in output/window-daylight. Isolated experiment build passed (existing chunk-size advisory only). No changes to the user's live browser/storage.

2026-09-16 — Whale loft side guards
- Diagnosed source geometry: original loft has headboard and front star railing but no side boards; not wall-view culling. Added rounded cream side boards with woodLight caps, leaving the front portion of the stair-side rail open for the landing. Footprint, anchor, catalog and under-bed cavity unchanged.
- Patched distributed kit with reproducible/idempotent repair-loft-guards.mjs (432 triangles, 2 material batches). Matching build.py geometry and export marker prevent re-export regressions or duplicate patches. Original blend/Blender runtime unavailable, so other kit assets were left intact.
- Official game client before/after images inspected; loft-guard-qa passed back/stair-side views, hidden walls and store/undo with no browser errors. Artifact directory output/loft-guard. No app runtime code change or new unit tests needed.
- Separately noticed existing room-shell corner caps float in no-wall mode; not caused by or addressed in this bed geometry fix.


2026-09-16 — Kitchen pack and floating action limbs
- Processed the user's kitchen ZIP into 15 geometry-only, authored-color assets (1,427,028 bytes total / 39,956 triangles). Geometry sources and kitchen-assets.mjs reproduce outputs; no source images, UVs or baked AI colors. Wood matches tea-table woodLight. Separated table/chairs/tabletop props and island props; pet bowls have a dedicated Pets category.
- Added dining preset and metadata-driven table/chair activities, shared docking, space/reach/tabletop checks, rigid scoop-to-mouth animation and reused bowl/spoon props. Eating lasts 12 seconds, returns to seated idle, ordinary emotes keep the seat. Added real fridge hinges, hollow liner/shelves, conservative opening clearance, cached shadow updates and transient open state.
- Latest user steering: action limbs are four independent smooth balls, enabled for sitting and special gestures/activities. Original hands hide during these poses and return for ordinary standing/walking. Feet hang independently; only the original tiny toes tuck inward, torso/contact height stays unchanged. Hand spheres move in visible arcs beside the head, never stretch. All four share one sphere geometry; colors use the existing chibi artwork/skin.
- 28 targeted unit tests passed; kitchen-qa passed real-chibi hand/foot visibility, rigid geometry, dining tabletop height, fridge cycles/rotation/storage/undo, category counts, mobile preset undo/redo and warmed GPU resource stability with no browser errors. Gaming QA passed computer/stream/race/rhythm and phone presets. Official adapted game client screenshot/state verified. Isolated production build passed with the existing chunk-size advisory.
- Close-up dining/gesture views and source/colored galleries inspected; eco idle stops rendering after the gesture. Output: output/kitchen. Docs: room3d-kitchen.md and updated seating protocol. Did not change the user's live storage or tab. Current interactions are manual from the chibi panel; autonomous dining/multiple seat occupants and fridge food retrieval remain future work.

2026-09-16 — Bathroom pack, washer repair, all-furniture paint and seated-only feet
- Locked the requirement: only seated poses reveal foot balls. Standing wave-cute/wave-calm/angry/dance show hand balls only, original toes remain; seated emotes keep all four and standing hides feet. Updated seating and room requirements.
- Converted ten clean geometry-only bathroom sources into 15 independently catalogued assets: 1,359,680 bytes / 43,392 triangles total, no images, UVs or vertex colors. Rebuilt the damaged washer with a sealed rounded body, ring door, curved blue window and clean controls; retained feet, separated towels/detergent, calibrated lid support. Rebuilt stool top, filled vanity basin bottom; tub/tray/soap have nested supports and conservative separate collisions. Authored palette and standard tea-table wood.
- Added real paint material targets for all 90 furniture. Presets, custom primary color and original-color reset preserve secondary materials; corrected custom color writing to the actual stored instance rather than item()'s coordinate-adjusted copy. Browser verified every furniture's actual mesh colors, reload/copy, reset, undo/redo, and stable warmed resources (457 geometries / 10 textures before and after eight changes in this fixture).
- 10 targeted bathroom/dining unit tests passed. Full real-chibi browser QA passed foot visibility, seated wave, nested support rotation/storage/undo, all 90 paints and history. Mobile 390x844 custom color, undo/redo/reset passed. Inspected front/back asset galleries and final room/mobile screenshots; official adapted game client used. Isolated production build passed (existing chunk-size advisory).
- Reproducible generator: art/jellyfish-home/bathroom-assets.mjs. Specs: docs/room3d-bathroom.md. Reports/images: output/bathroom. User's live room/tab/storage untouched. Bathroom shower/bath/laundry/toilet animations are not implemented; stool seating and tabletop support are implemented.

2026-09-17 — Bedroom pack, sleeping and huggable plush
- Processed the bedroom ZIP into 25 independently placed/recolored geometry-only assets: 1,201,132 bytes / 40,200 triangles total, largest asset 143,368 bytes. Authored cream/lavender/pink/blue and standard tea-table wood; no image textures, UVs or vertex colors. Separated seats and tabletop props, repaired wardrobe fronts and mirror faces, retained bed guards and loft desk cavity; corrected desk-chair geometry facing after visual QA.
- Added bedroom collection, four special holdable toys, six sleeping positions across four beds and two bench seats. Bed posture is face-up with closed eyes and breathing; foot balls remain seated-only. Bed choice is manual; upper beds do not have climbing animation or multiple occupant reservation yet.
- User requested a substantial armful-sized toy: standing/seated hugs uniformly fit each doll, independent hands cradle the actual width/depth without stretched arms. Original instance hides temporarily, clone reuses geometry/materials, put-back preserves placement/color/count. Storage, gestures, room transitions and reload release transient holding. User corrected the animal: it is a shark, now named 软绵鲨鱼玩偶; legacy asset key is retained for placed-save compatibility.
- 118 related room/chibi unit checks passed; bedroom's four checks reran after final asset orientation correction. Browser QA passed all six beds, four dolls, seated hug, original-position preservation, storage/undo/reload, mobile interaction and stable warmed GPU resources, without browser errors. Additional browser QA exercised custom color and original-color reset on all 25 new pieces and every new seat.
- Front/back asset galleries, sleep, hug and seat screenshots inspected. Close-up hug/sleep camera now looks downward; dense arrangements can still occlude the character and need orbit adjustment. Isolated experiment production build passed (existing chunk-size advisory). Test fixture uses separate storage; user's live room/tab untouched. Specs: docs/room3d-bedroom.md; reports/screenshots: output/bedroom.

2026-09-17 — Shark colors, room isolation and closer camera
- Corrected shark to authored blue-gray back/fins and cream underside, preserving silhouette/size and legacy asset ID. Belly is partitioned from existing geometry and shares its smoothed normals; no texture or added drawing pass beyond two material batches. Only blue is the customizable primary color. Catalog HTTP cache revalidation and a per-model revision make refreshed editors load current labels/assets; an already-mounted editor had kept its initially loaded catalog.
- Room panel now has same-floor / only-current-room scope with local device preference, room switching and temporary overview override. Single scope follows cross-room walking, clears hidden furniture activities instead of recursive rebuilds, and retains the shared boundary geometry owned by an unseen neighbor. Physical layout/navigation and home save contents are unchanged by the scope toggle.
- Raised button/wheel/pinch maximum zoom from 2.8 to 6 using shared OrbitControls limits. Scope and room changes fit the camera; furniture edits preserve it.
- 21 topology/bedroom/finishes checks passed. room-scope-qa.mjs passed single/multiple-room switching, overview return, reload preference, unchanged furniture/walls, button/wheel zoom limits, narrow mobile layout and actual shark labels/materials in the hug. Official game client and final single-room/mobile/shark screenshots inspected, browser errors empty. User's live tab and storage untouched.
- Isolated experiment production build passed after the scope/cache/zoom changes (existing large-chunk advisory only).

2026-09-17 — Double-tap resident focus and drag-to-pan
- Added visible/occlusion-aware resident picking with a shared pointer-based double-tap path for mouse and touch. First click on the resident does not route a walk; double tap fits the visible character/held-prop bounds at the visual center, preserves angle, and stops a current walk without changing position. No delayed single-click timers or extra render loop.
- Left-mouse and one-finger empty-space dragging now pan in screen space. Right drag and two-finger dolly/rotate remain available. Selected furniture drag disables both pan and rotate; cancellation/multitouch restore controls. Track threshold crossing even if the pointer returns to its starting location to avoid accidental walking/clicks.
- camera-qa.mjs passed desktop and touch focus, zoom, unchanged resident position, no unwanted walk, pan with unchanged viewing offset, right rotation, selected furniture drag and undo. Screenshots for desktop/mobile focused and panned views inspected; browser errors empty. Adapted official game client ran successfully after restoring the stopped local Vite service on 5174 and allowing its cold startup to finish. Test pages use isolated storage.
- Final isolated experiment build passed; existing bundle-size advisory only.

2026-09-17 — Gesture mapping revised by user
- User found single-finger pan unintuitive. Current controls supersede the preceding mapping: one finger / left mouse rotates; two fingers dolly + pan; right mouse pans. Resident double tap, six-times maximum zoom, furniture drag exclusion and walk-click handling retained. Updated in-app hints and room guide.
- Updated camera-qa.mjs passed desktop left rotate/right pan, touch single rotate, two-touch translation with stable zoom/orientation, pinch zoom with stable orientation, no accidental walking, double-tap focus and selected furniture drag/undo. Revised mobile screenshots inspected; browser errors empty.

2026-09-17 — Furniture room/use browsing and action markers
- Added furnitureCatalog.js with a complete explicit purpose map for all 115 shipped furniture, five room categories (including living-room TV/cabinet), and the requested fourteen purpose categories. Browsing no longer mixes asset collection, placement surfaces and interaction capability. Existing placement, IDs, colors, saved state and action rules remain intact; building/walls/doors stay in the building panel.
- Added room/use tabs; mobile purpose dropdown keeps thumbnails visible. Empty purposes remain selectable. Thumbnail upper-right Action badge is derived from implemented seat/bed/hug/watering/fridge/activity/dining capabilities; old uncalibrated models are not falsely marked. Combo requirements appear in the tooltip/selected furniture details. Storage and restoration reuse the badge.
- Latest broad plants category includes flowers/vases/tabletop greenery; floor+waterable still gates watering. Documented next-round requirements separately: dining by tableware location, arbitrary compatible table/chair docking, and computer+table/chair play. These are requested future interaction changes, not implemented in this classification pass.
- Updated affected earlier UI QA selectors for the two-axis taxonomy. Eleven catalog/bedroom/watering unit checks passed. catalog-qa passed every room/use filter, empty categories, all 115 badge decisions (22 interactive assets), place/store/restore, gaming/dining preset visibility, building access and mobile layout; no browser errors. Official game client plus final badge/mobile images inspected. Isolated experiment production build passed with existing chunk-size advisory. Output: output/furniture-catalog. User's live storage/tab untouched.
## 2026-09-17 · Coarse editable showrooms
- Processed `Meshy_AI_assets_20260917_062133.zip`: five fused room meshes plus ribbon door; excluded exterior spa rock garden. Geometry-only sources retained with manifest; no source images/UV/colors.
- Added 25 independently editable furniture objects, capped below 4000 triangles including all material groups; max 3567, plus 3311-triangle hinged door. Rebuilt damaged hidden cabinet backs, tables/island and plant-fused wardrobe as documented.
- Five sample rooms append into neighboring empty cells from Rooms/Expand; same commit/undo/save/mobile limits. New procedural stone/parquet floor and timber/tile wall patterns. Existing layout remains intact.
- Real-browser checks: templates, undo/redo/reload, sofa and bed poses, paint, ribbon door traversal, mobile sixth-room atomic rejection. Sofa seat moved forward to avoid source pillows. Test fixtures isolate localStorage.
- Validation: 17 room3d test files / 112 tests pass, isolated experimental-page build passes, official game client and QA scripts report no browser errors. Screenshots/reports in output/showrooms. No commit or push this turn.

- Showroom palette correction: user prefers source-pack colors. Visually compared original GLBs in an ignored isolated reference view, then manually authored dark-wood/cream themes, black-white kitchen, olive living pouf, white/gray-green bedding, and pink/white/gold ribbon door. No image sampling or image channels shipped. Added procedural spa wainscot. Regenerated all furniture within budget and reran template UI, paint-contract/finish tests and the isolated build.

2026-09-17 — Bedroom mirrors, plants and wardrobe
- Widened source wardrobe 1.55 → 2.2; added two separate mirrors plus original-source large/small foliage with repaired closed pots. No image channels; every new asset below 3000 triangles.
- Removed fused room scraps; rebuilt source-proportion oval rim and matching arched standing mirror. Large plant is waterable; small plant uses pot contact footprint on the low cabinet; dressing mirror stays attached to the dresser.
- Bedroom preset now 15 pieces with entry/watering clearance. Fresh fixture key decor4 leaves existing homes untouched.
- 118 room3d tests pass across full run + corrected targeted rerun (new test initially held stale pre-move object). Vite build passes with existing bundle warning. Browser extras QA passed watering, grouped storage, undo/redo and reload; skill client screenshot inspected.

2026-09-17 — Furniture-local game action wheel
- Replaced furniture action lists in the chibi panel with a click-on-furniture wheel. Authored beds/seats, watering, plush, gaming/dining dependencies and fridge controls reuse existing action dispatch. Self emotes and stop/stand/put-back stay in the chibi panel.
- User steered toward a game HUD: code SVG icons, soft local halo/dashed arc, purple hover/focus, wide-screen left dock. Then requested smaller object-local UI: wheel uses projected furniture bounds, scales with camera and follows orbit/pinch; 44px minimum touch targets and compact pagination.
- Investigated face clarity: composition is 472px and old Clear capped DPR without supersampling ordinary 1x monitors. Desktop Clear now actually renders at 1.5x; mobile, eco and balanced budgets unchanged. No AI image, extra face polygons or inflated source textures.
- Added six contract tests and actual browser interaction QA; final verification recorded in tool results. No model assets altered this turn and no commit/push.
- Final verification: 19 room3d files / 124 tests passed; final standalone Vite build passed (existing >500KB warning). Browser desktop + phone portrait/landscape passed after changing the plant hit target from an empty foliage bounding-box center to its visible pot. Menu scale follows zoom; orbit keeps it attached; screenshots reviewed at furniture-arc-desktop/phone/landscape.png. Existing actual behavior still uses direct pose placement, not walk-to-seat transitions.

2026-09-18 — Merge remote rigged-body / retro-furniture branch
- User requested merge of origin/codex/chibi-rig-wardrobe-20260918, tip d8c36a2c (00:23 +0800). Backed up all pre-merge working files with SHA256 manifest in output/merge-backup-20260918; checkpointed only local 3D work as 7e1665b1. Unrelated chat/memory edits match backup byte-for-byte and remain uncommitted.
- Resolved editor and documentation conflicts by retaining showroom/catalog/bed/hug/action-wheel/per-part paint features alongside incoming new body, facial atlas supersampling, wardrobe/FK fixtures and furniture retro shading/outline controls. Kept camera panning and desktop Clear 1.5x. Moved experiment appearance controls clear of desktop dock.
- Scope caveat: new body home sitting/walking animations remain unimplemented on incoming branch; existing classic body remains default. Wardrobe and FK editor are isolated prototypes.
- Validation: 20 files / 129 room3d + rig tests passed. Experiment production build passed; fixture build passed with esnext for the existing top-level await fixture (initial default-target fixture build rejected top-level await). Existing bundle size advisory remains.
- Browser: desktop and phone portrait/landscape furniture-action QA passed; synchronized the landscape test with canvas resize after an initial stale-projection timeout. Retro/original and outline toggles preserve room state; Clear is 1.5x; independent pillow paint works. New rig fixture reports 3900 triangles, 1952 vertices, 22 bones, 944px face atlas; raised-arm preset rendered. Screenshots inspected, no page/shader errors. Reports in output/merge-20260918 and output/showrooms.

2026-09-18 — New-body basic motion trial
- User asked to try making the new body move, then asked about open animation libraries. Verified official Quaternius Universal Animation Library (CC0, free subset / paid extras) and Three.js retargetClip documentation. No external clips downloaded; authored small FK calibration poses first.
- Added blankMotion.ts: natural arms-down idle, elbow/wrist wave, cute wave/head tilt, bent-hip/knee sitting, seated upper-body emotes with fixed seat contact, gentle walk, nod/sway and basic whole-body lying. Bone lengths, scale and geometry are unchanged. Original round chibi animation branch is untouched.
- New-body visitors wear the existing geometry-only hoodie/sock/boot outfit on the same skeleton; removed duplicate clothing from the seating fixture. Rig-only/skin comparison editor remains separate. Per-avatar disposal owns clothing resources.
- 132 tests across 21 files passed, including new planted-feet, rigid bone length, seated pelvis/wave, stand reset and finite skinned-clothing checks. Experiment + seating production build passed (existing chunk warning). Browser UI exercised stand, wave, real chair/sofa action menu, seated wave, camera rotation; screenshots inspected. Skill game client passed and screenshot/state inspected. Reports/screenshots: output/new-body-motion; reusable QA: art/jellyfish-home/new-body-motion-qa.mjs.
- Limitations: no external animation-pack import yet; no walk-to-seat approach sequence, full IK, device-specific hand contacts, or new-body full furniture certification. High-raised hoodie sleeves still need weights cleanup. Existing unrelated chat/memory work preserved.

2026-09-18 — Seated hands at the sides
- User requested both hands naturally hanging beside the body when seated. Removed forward-reaching seated shoulder/elbow angles; left sleeve clearance and relaxed wrists. Upper-body waving still overrides only the waving side; idle restores the seated rest pose. Legs/contact height unchanged.
- Existing three blankMotion tests passed. Expanded browser QA with front seated view and return-to-idle/stand checks; initial software-WebGL run timed out after the final panel click, so the isolated QA uses eco quality and a 60s action timeout. Seated front screenshot visually confirms hands at the sides.
- Final browser rerun passed seated wave → idle → stand; skill game client completed and screenshot reviewed. No browser errors.


2026-09-18 — Hoodie reference proportions, shoulders and closer focus
- User confirmed matching the supplied Blush Hoodie Doll head/body ratio. Measured both normalized meshes; kept torso/limbs and bone lengths, fitted head at the neck and scaled hair with it. Added a regression check for reference ratios and unchanged torso/feet.
- Re-extracted geometry-only hoodie at 2,615 triangles + 669 boots (3,284 total, below 4,000 outfit budget). Smoothed shoulder transfer with continuous garment-space influences; masked covered upper-body faces as one region to avoid leftover skin strips. No image textures.
- Raised wave now nearly straight, angled outward with wrist motion. Tests check elbow alignment and wrist clearance from the bare head; seated hands still rest beside the body. No general hair collision/IK solver added.
- Camera maximum zoom 10; focus and crouched view fit actual actor bounds more closely.
- Validation: 10 rig/motion tests passed; full UI stand → wave → sofa → seated wave → rest → stand passed with no browser errors. Stand/wave/seated screenshots inspected; skill client screenshot/state inspected. Three-entry standalone Vite build passed (existing large-chunk advisory). Fixture: test/fixtures/chibi-shoulder.html; local reference preview is opt-in.
- Final regression: 21 files / 134 tests passed with --no-cache (normal run hit a pre-existing results-cache EPERM after all tests passed). Front/side/back shoulder comparisons inspected; no remaining skin strips at the shoulder seam in these poses.


2026-09-18 — Face smoothing and independent body proportion sliders
- User requested smoother mouth region and editable head size/height. Added cached depth-only lower-face relaxation, preserving vertex/triangle count, silhouette and face UVs.
- Added headSize (75–140%) and bodyHeight (80–125%) to HairSettings, default 100% of hoodie reference. Height changes torso/legs and bind joint positions/clothes, not head shape; seated hips retain a fixed contact plane.
- Added reusable BodyControls in Little World’s “调整比例” popover and creator 3D settings. Grouped pointer/keyboard changes, undo/redo, proportion-only reset and local persistence; fixed stale “待绑骨” copy. Creator previews now fit and dress the new body consistently with the home view.
- Keep old avatar until replacement is ready. Proportion-only replacement preserves actions/seat/location; focused camera re-fits the changed silhouette so taller heads are not cropped. Manual camera controls cancel automatic framing.
- Targeted tests cover mouth curvature reduction, unchanged topology/UVs, old/invalid saved data, independent dimensions, extreme-proportion bind/pose finite coordinates and seated contact. Browser verifies both sliders, undo/redo/reset, reload persistence and creator/phone UI. No AI textures or extra triangles added.
- Final verification: 22 files / 137 tests passed with --no-cache; three-entry Vite build passed (existing bundle warning). Real sofa interaction survived changing to 130% head / 80% height while seated, then seated wave and stand passed without browser errors. Desktop/mobile/creator controls and skill-client screenshot/state inspected. Mobile proportion panel moved below the scene to preserve the view.


2026-09-18 — User reverted mouth smoothing, default head 104%
- Removed cached facial depth relaxation; restored the original source facial relief and retained existing normals/UVs. Default and reset head size now 104%, height remains 100%; explicit saved proportions remain unchanged. Updated geometry/default/reset regressions and browser QA.
- Verified 13 rig/motion/proportion tests passed after the revert; no whole-repo rollback and no existing custom saved proportions overwritten.

2026-09-18 — Five fingers, straight wrists and lower-face profile
- Rebuilt from geometry-only Tiny T-Pose 0918044240 reference with connected procedural five-finger hands. User rejected wrist pinches and a separate nose tip: wrists now continue forearm width; only the broad mouth-to-chin profile is pushed outward. No facial depth-relaxation restored, default head stays 104%.
- Body is 1,885 vertices / 3,766 triangles, one closed connected surface. Offline source normals retained and transformed correctly with head/height changes. Outfit remains 3,284 triangles. Fingers currently follow the hand bone, no individual finger rig.
- Validation: 15 geometry/rig/motion/proportion tests passed; three-entry Vite build passed (existing chunk-size advisory). Inspected profile, face, wrist/hand and skill-client screenshot/state. Browser stand/wave/seat/proportion change/seated wave/stand passed with no errors on stable rerun; first run was interrupted by development HMR during a source comment edit.
- Comparison preview: output/body-refinement/index.html; rebuild tool: art/chibi/refine-body.mjs. Original reference GLB and unrelated chat/memory changes untouched. No commit/push.

2026-09-18 — Independent finger rig
- Added two joints per digit on both hands, appending 20 bones after the original 22. Capsule-local weights keep neighboring tips and wrists independent; mesh/topology unchanged. Shared hand-curl API drives natural rest, open waving hand and angry fists without stretching bones.
- Pose editor lists localized finger joints, smaller joint handles, open/relaxed/fist presets; persistence/import/export retain finger rotations. Existing body-only drafts remain valid. Added chibi-fingers preview with three hand poses, side toggle and skeleton toggle.
- Validation: 18 relevant tests pass; isolated 3-entry Vite build passes (existing large chunk advisory). Skill-client left/right hand screenshots and text inspected. Browser confirms 42 options, individual finger edit, reload, pose JSON roundtrip and 42-joint GLB export; no page errors. First QA assertion was corrected to tolerate equivalent numeric -0/0 after opening a hand.
- Finger posing is FK, not collision-aware grasping/IK; low-poly knuckle contours are still visible at extreme closure. No additional model faces or image textures, no commit/push; unrelated user changes preserved.

2026-09-18 — Incoming clothing pack classification
- Inspected Meshy_AI_assets_20260918_090720.zip: 10 full-figure GLBs, no image textures or skins; 01/02 have 9/5 mesh parts, others single meshes. Original whole-figure counts range 123,992–631,792 triangles. Original archive untouched; extracted files and pure-color three-view renders in output/clothing-pack-0918.
- Registered source folder IDs and six garment families in art/chibi/clothing-pack-0918.json; detailed categories and extraction/rigging contract in docs/chibi-clothing-assets.md. Reuse 01/02 camisoles/footwear; group 09/10 fitted knit, 04/05/08 loose knit, 01/02/06/07 trousers. Off-shoulder/open-front and collar changes remain structural variants, not direct morphs between unrelated topology.
- User asked whether to remove the people first: no wholesale re-export needed; exploit existing parts then inspect fused openings individually. This is classification/reference intake, NOT yet stripped/rigged wearable assets; manifest status explicitly extraction-preview. Next: garment-only extraction, <=4000 triangles per item, body masks and actual motion validation before catalog integration. No runtime defaults or user wardrobe changed.

2026-09-18 — User-requested clothing work rollback / checkpoint
- Stopped unfinished clothing implementation at the user's request. Removed the new extraction script, wardrobe runtime, garment JSON outputs, try-on fixture, associated draft tests and generated try-on captures. Retained source inventory, reference renders, six-family selection manifest and clothing requirements only.
- Earlier completed body proportions, five-finger rig, motions and hoodie work remain intact. Clothing pack remains extraction-preview, not production-ready; no new wardrobe resources are required by the app. Unrelated chat/memory edits remain outside this checkpoint.
- Checkpoint validation: 5 relevant test files / 18 tests passed; isolated chibi experiment, fingers and shoulder Vite build passed (existing large-chunk advisory). No runtime references to removed clothing-pack drafts remain.

2026-09-20 — Sailor girl rear hem clearance
- Corrected rear lower blouse geometry in the rigged preview and independent top GLBs; smooth 0.085 maximum rear offset with inverse-transpose normals. Front/collar/sleeves, UV paint, topology, bones and weights preserved.
- Reproducible/idempotent post-export tool: art/chibi/fix-sailor-back-hem.mjs. Blender is unavailable locally; existing blend sources are unchanged and require this documented GLB post-process after export.
- Default front/side/back and A-back screenshots inspected, browser errors empty. Fifteen rest-pose rear-waist ray samples have >=0.037 clearance to skirt. Existing seated-skirt limitations remain. No commit/push; unrelated local work untouched.

2026-09-20 — Independent skirt waist / shorts rear clearance
- Fixed skirt-only jagged waist: body mask ceiling 2.70 exceeded the skirt's 2.49 waistband. Both lower garments now preserve skin above 2.45; source and prebuilt preview predicate synchronized.
- Rear shorts white patch confirmed as body penetration by hiding the body in isolated QA. Adjusted 34 rear-crotch vertices with transformed normals; updated user-painted runtime, pants-only and outfit GLBs, retained paint/UVs/weights/topology. Idempotent post-export script added; Blender masters remain unchanged.
- Existing bundled motion dependencies wardrobePose/retargetHappyWave are missing from the pulled source checkpoint; preserved bundle and applied exact mask predicate patch rather than rebuilding missing modules. Previous girl back-hem fix preserved; no commit/push.
- Validation: isolated preview screenshots inspected for both lower garments alone and relaxed arms; clothing off restores all 6,136 body triangles, toggling on returns the same mask. Browser errors empty; compiled JS syntax check passed; skill-client screenshot inspected. Runtime GLB audit confirms only pants position/normal bytes changed and normals remain normalized.

2026-09-20 — Skirt waistband body penetration
- Restored waist skin revealed the outer skirt was too tight at the front/sides. Fit the upper shell to actual body cross-sections with a smooth lower transition; 50 vertex records moved, maximum 0.0543. Skirt hem and shorts lining unchanged.
- Runtime and independent skirt updated together; idempotent post-export script art/chibi/fit-sailor-skirt-waist.mjs recorded in clothing docs. Blender masters remain unchanged; earlier rear blouse correction retained.
- Checked close front/side/back/diagonal and full outfit back in isolated browser, no page errors; clothing visibility restores original body indices. 192 waist ray samples have >=0.0301 radial clearance. Binary audit proves only outer-shell position/normal data changed and normals are normalized. Skill-client smoke screenshot inspected. No commit/push.

2026-09-20 — Sailor girl garment fit sliders
- Added skirt length, sleeve length and cuff width to current standalone preview, with undo/redo/reset and scoped local persistence. Rest-space deformation keeps upper waistband/shoulder roots and existing rig/UVs, recomputes transformed normals and matching body masks. Default restores exact initial vertex/normal values; no geometry accumulation or added triangles.
- Shared dependency-free garment-fit.js is wired from source and the preserved bundle; absent wardrobePose/retargetHappyWave source modules still prevent a full bundle rebuild. Other clothing presets remain unchanged. Current safe ranges cover short-sleeve tweaks; long sleeves need elbow weighting, seated skirt remains a known limitation.
- Browser QA passed minimum/maximum settings, T/A and waving while adjusting, undo/redo/reset including reset undo, reload persistence, body visibility, actual adjusted GLB export, mobile width and male preview smoke. Screenshots inspected; page errors empty. Skill-client screenshot/state inspected; fixed the standalone page's missing favicon request. No commit/push.

2026-09-20 — Four new lower garments and preview menu cleanup
- Extracted belt long skirt, straight trousers, cargo trousers and cropped wide-leg trousers from the four user-supplied GLBs. Removed attached people and source image texture; solid materials, waist/crotch clearance and current skeleton binding. Long skirt gains horizontal deformation bands. Final garments: 1518 / 679 / 1703 / 864 triangles, each one draw call, with independent geometry-only and rigged exports.
- Added four lower-* entries to the existing preview and length controls (85–105%), undo/redo/reset, scoped persistence and body masks. Source and preserved bundle updated together. Removed the five obsolete comparison choices requested in the screenshot; legacy URLs redirect to the confirmed detail cardigan, historical files retained.
- Validated front/back, walk and sitting screenshots, slider bounds/history/reset/reload, full body restore, model export, mobile layout, legacy redirects and existing female outfit controls. GLBs have no images, normalized weights and <4000 triangles per garment. Skill-client screenshot/state inspected. Long skirt deep seated folds remain a documented trial limitation; not registered in the game wardrobe or claimed fully validated across body proportions. No commit/push.

2026-09-20 — Shoes / shorts from 032526 pack
- Inspected the four untextured GLBs by connected components. Extracted geta (860 triangles), lace boots (1250), sneakers (2236), loose shorts (1185); source people omitted, original archive untouched. Solid materials, two shoe draw calls / one shorts draw call; independent and current-body rig exports in output/cardigan-controller/shoes/.
- Adapted to current feet, foot/shin weights and geta ground offset. Opened capped boot ankles; rebuilt only the sneaker's intersecting inner/outer collar as a rounded open band. Shorts needed current-body waist/crotch scaling, deformation bands and explicit thigh/hip transition; automatic nearest-body weights alone failed sitting.
- Added dependency-free body-occlusion.js: clip the hidden skin geometrically rather than whole-triangle masks, interpolate normalized weights, reuse original vertices, restore original geometry on clothing off. Applies to new shoes / these shorts only. Added menu entries and shorts length/history/persistence using existing controls; preserved bundle and source entry points synchronized. Formal game wardrobe and Blender masters untouched.
- QA: inspected close front/side/walking/seated screenshots, including actual animation advancement (earlier timeline-only screenshots were not a valid pose check). Shoes follow the feet; shorts now follow thighs, but seated creases remain stylized and rigid, not cloth simulation / all-body-proportion validation. Length min/max, undo/redo/reset/reload, full body restore, sailor controls smoke passed. GLB asset audit: no images, <4000 garment triangles, finite positions and normalized weights. Current-model exports checked; skill client screenshot/state inspected; page errors empty. Source review files moved out of served shoes directory. No commit/push.

2026-09-20 — Straight shorts waist / hip correction
- User clarified that the doll has almost no waist/hip curves. Promoted this to the clothing import requirements: never inherit a source human's pinched waist, widened hips or protruding seat.
- Added a shorts-only cross-section remap after adaptation: continuous near-straight side width, reduced front/back depth, no local hip bulge. Kept 1185 triangles, crotch/leg split, hem height, controls and current rig. Updated both shorts GLBs; source archive and body unchanged.
- Checked front/side and animated sit/walk screenshots, length/history/reset/reload/visibility and sailor smoke; GLB finite values / normalized weights / no images audit passed. Skill client screenshot and state inspected; no page errors. Rigid seated folds remain a trial limitation. No commit/push.

2026-09-20 — Waist fit controls and reusable directional pleats
- Added waist 80–120% to lowerwear, shorts default 90%; rest-body section clearance with cached samples, smooth upper-waist influence, combined history/reset/local persistence/current GLB export. Kept a separate complete body surface so visibility masks cannot corrupt later radius queries.
- User clarified that a pleat is a broad sloped sheet joined by a narrow opposite-facing sheet, repeated in one direction. Replaced the trial smooth skirt and shelf-shaped four-panel folds with this two-panel knife-pleat cross-section. Canonical geometry-only factory art/chibi/pleated-skirt.mjs is copied to served runtime by build-lowerwear-0920.mjs. Existing source belt retained.
- Added live 12–24 even pleat count, default 20. Rebuilds only main cloth from immutable template, retains belt, rebinds normalized hip/thigh/shin weights; updates export metadata for actual count and vertex/index prefixes. Default 1413 garment triangles; max 1669. Existing rigid deep-seated limitation remains; no cloth simulation claimed.
- Browser checks cover waist defaults/extremes, length+waist history/reload/export/visibility, pleat-count combinations/history/reload/reset and exported metadata/geometry. Inspected front/side/back and min/max screenshots; asset audit passed. One concurrent QA browser timed out on a final generic-pants reset click, so outstanding generic-pants smoke is rerun serially. No commit/push.
- Final serial generic-pants waist/reset smoke passed for straight/cargo/cropped. Final two-panel pleat skill-client screenshot/state inspected; no new browser errors.

2026-09-20 — Second clothing intake, corrected footwear scope
- User clarified that the three standalone shoes in 044506 ARE wanted. Skip only the source pleated skirt and attached shoes/socks in 055133; keep previously completed styles.
- Added build-clothing-0920b.mjs and shared clothing-import-utils.mjs; ten independent pure-color assets (three shoes, five tops/coats, apron, headband), all under 4000 garment triangles, paired only/rig GLBs and manifest. ZIP source files remain under ignored output/clothing-0920b/source and Downloads are untouched.
- Converted source A-pose clothing to the current 48-bone rest rig; corrected cuff-to-hip misassignment, collapsed finger influences to hand, kept headband separate, and subdivided/weighted the long coat hem. Shoe side ownership is by connected component and boot inner/outer walls retain thickness.
- New workbench entries, apparel visibility/body restoration, preserved existing footwear controls. Added narrow ignore exceptions for runtime assets/modules required by the already-tracked workbench; no intake/QA output exposed to Git.
- Final QA is in output/clothing-0920b: front/back, real seated posture (assert thigh rotation), walk, visibility restoration; asset audit checks no image textures, normalized finite weights, 48-joint indices, finite positions/normals, triangle budget. Deep long-coat folds remain skeletal, not cloth simulation. No formal game wardrobe integration, commit or push.
- Final checks passed for all ten entries; browser error list is empty. Inspected front/back contact sheets and final skill-client screenshots/state, exported current shoe and shirt GLBs successfully, and git diff whitespace check passed. The last fit pass raises shoulder crowns, shortens overlong sleeves to the current wrist, and welds the blazer torso/sleeve split before smoothing; its final count is 1592 triangles. Preview opening requested for quality=lace-midboots.

2026-09-20 — Apron shoulder straps, bending boots, authored laces and neck accessories
- User requested apron shoulder clipping repair, boots bending together with legs, replacement boot laces, and independent necktie/bow-tie parts. Added art/chibi/clothing-details.mjs; builder emits twelve assets, no AI/image textures.
- Replaced apron upper straps with thin shoulder-surface ribbons; retained source waist/apron decorations. Boot source shafts contained recessed caps and their ankle centres were behind the doll's legs: rebuilt shafts from the exact ankle cut boundaries onto body cross-sections, keeping toe/sole meshes, leg skin interpolation and real cuff thickness. Preserve shoe side ownership through deformation.
- Rebuilt six-row crossed laces, eyelets and small knots. Added independently exported necktie (100 triangles) and bow-tie (180), accessory workbench entries and visibility labels. Current lace boots 3163, tall boots 1362, apron 2085 triangles; full metadata manifest rebuilt.
- QA files: output/clothing-0920b/detail-qa.mjs and seam-audit.mjs. Checks include front/back/raised arms, real seated and walking poses, full body restoration, pure materials, normalized skin weights, and posed boot-rim distances. Contrast-body apron screenshot is diagnostic only; user body colors are untouched.
- User superseded the separate shaft shape: use a sock-like upper section that bends exactly with the leg. Replaced the lofted upper shaft with a clipped copy of the actual leg surface and its skin weights, offset by 0.018; original foot/sole retained, source ankle aligned to the doll, connector uses union perimeter samples and blended weights. Final counts: lace boots 3379, tall boots 1844. No new anatomy or independent rigid knee tube.
- Final twelve-asset audit and five changed-entry browser checks passed. Inspected final tall-boot seated and lace-boot close-up captures, plus skill client screenshot/state (skill-sock-final). Sock audit verifies exported cuff weights against the body surface and tracks the corresponding interpolated skin anchor through standing/walk/seated; do not mistake interpolation of already-posed coarse triangle corners for the cut-vertex skin operation. No browser page errors; git diff whitespace check passed. Existing low-poly surface faceting remains; no claim of universal pose collision solving. No commit/push.

2026-09-20 — User rejected boot connector folds and invented calf shaping
- The previous acceptance was incorrect: low-angle images show an obvious ring of fan-like folds at the connector. User explicitly reiterated that both medium and tall boots must respect straight doll legs; do not invent calf bulges or tapered ankles.
- Replaced the clipped-body/irregular-connector approach with a single constant elliptical shaft, retaining authored toe/sole and fitting the upper foot to the exact same perimeter. Continuous analytic shaft normals remove the alternating dark facets from uneven source edge spacing.
- Every horizontal ring now has one uniform foot/shin/thigh blend; top section follows thigh, ankle follows foot, laces share the same weights. This prevents the serrated back cuff caused by sampling different body weights around the same ring. Body mask retains more overlap inside each cuff.
- Added art/chibi/verify-boot-fit.mjs to check constant shaft bounds, smooth normals and leg ownership. Dedicated visual checks: output/clothing-0920b/straight-boots-qa.mjs covers both boots in standing/walk/sit/ankle-flexion, front/low/side (24 views). Old seam-audit.mjs checks a superseded construction and is not the current acceptance test. Final geometry counts: lace-midboots 3163, tall-boots 1458.
- Final checks passed: straight-shaft/ring-weight regression, full asset audit, 24 browser pose/view captures with no page errors, and adapted skill client screenshot/state in skill-straight-final. Inspected low-angle front/walk/ankle and seated side images; the fan folds and serrated posterior rim are removed. Source and served bundle use ?v=straight-shaft-r2 for both boot GLBs so a reloaded preview requests the new assets. Requested existing browser tab navigation; Codex reported queued. No commit/push.
- Final medium-boot mask boundary is 0.955 (tall remains 1.10): the prior 0.88 overlap exposed a small white patch below the back cuff in seated side view. Rebuilt the manifest/assets and reran medium-boot pose views; inspected seated side to confirm the exposed patch is removed. Geometry and weights unchanged by this last mask correction.

2026-09-20 — Refine remaining boot instep notch
- User approved the straight shafts but pointed out a remaining middle crease. Smoothed the source foot-to-shaft handoff earlier, filled the inherited ankle recess, and preserved cross-section width through the instep so its side silhouette no longer inherits the source ankle pinch. Kept toe/sole, straight upper shaft and existing bone weighting.
- Both assets rebuilt with unchanged triangle budgets (3163 / 1458); boot GLB cache revision is straight-shaft-r3. Constant shaft/normal/leg-ownership checks passed, asset audit passed, and standing/walk/sit/ankle screenshots captured for both boots without page errors. Screenshot capture uses page screenshots after the canvas locator's stability wait timed out. Final cut-ring float tolerance correction was rechecked by geometry regression and the adapted skill client (skill-straight-r3); inspected its image and visible footwear state. Existing browser tab refresh requested (queued). No commit/push.

2026-09-21 — Mirror outfit trips
- User asked for actual wardrobe/mirror back-and-forth, with teleport when the wardrobe cannot be reached. Added two finite rounds, wardrobe selection pauses, mirror posing, existing collision-aware paths and safe endpoint teleport fallback. The trip lives on the temporary activity and is cancelled by existing stop/edit/room/action flows.
- Wardrobe pose uses real furniture rotation/depth and body/head clearance. Fully blocked standing space stays disabled rather than teleporting into geometry. Reduced motion completes at the mirror.
- 18 targeted tests passed; isolated bedroom build passed with existing bundle advisory. Ran skill game client adapted only for bundled Playwright/Edge and fixture readiness/start, inspected wardrobe and mirror screenshots in output/mirror-journey; no browser errors. In-app UI verified the stop button immediately returns to idle. No outstanding implementation TODOs.

2026-09-21 — Simplified mirror controls to 臭美 / 穿搭; removed mirror rest buttons from furniture menus and chibi panel, and removed the obsolete rest hint. Other activities retain their controls. 13 targeted tests and active mirror menu assertion passed.

2026-09-21 — Bathroom zoning and shared black/green/white palette
- Replaced the scattered bathroom fixture with left wet zone, back vanity/linen zone, right rear toilet and right front laundry grouping. Moved the stool back into the wet zone after the wide-head route check exposed blocked vanity access. Kept the center clear and nested tub/washer props attached.
- Bathroom assets now use sage, off-white and charcoal, with original wood as minor trim; removed pink/blue accents in the reproducible generator and re-exported the same geometry with a cache revision. New isolated preview key preserves existing saved rooms.
- Added docs/room3d-layout.md with the user's ordered priorities, complete kitchen/island/living/reading/decor combinations and bathroom combinations; linked it as mandatory reading from AGENTS.md and furniture asset instructions.
- Five bathroom tests pass, including entrance paths to all five functional areas for headWidth 1.8. Isolated bathroom production build passes (existing bundle-size advisory). Skill game client captures inspected in output/bathroom-zoned-final; browser preview refreshed and alternate view checked. No geometry additions or actual bathroom-use animations in this change.

2026-09-21 — Matched bathroom accent to bedroom sage #81916b; shower shell/frame now charcoal with independently green spray head. Preserved preview positions/custom colors when aligning the previous palette. Re-exported assets with revision 2; five bathroom tests pass, game-client screenshot inspected in output/bathroom-palette-match, preview refreshed.

2026-09-22 — Completed supplied bathroom reference
- Kept reference wet zone on left, vanity/linen/toilet on rear wall and inward-facing laundry group at front. New reference supersedes earlier black shower-shell request: sage frame with dark fittings. Warm white tiles/walls, sage and dark cabinetry remain shared with bedroom/kitchen.
- Built 16 reusable geometry-only assets (28 placed items, including two botanical prints), added static tub water, wall window daylight, shelf/towel/robe groups, vines, rugs, slippers and laundry props. Every new asset is below 4000 triangles with no images, UVs or vertex colors. Existing bath geometry unchanged except added water plane.
- Fixed left print/shelf overlap. Eight bathroom/catalog tests pass, including no furniture collisions, nested support and wide-head paths to five functional areas; standalone fixture production build passes with existing size warning. Preview key bathroom-reference-2 preserves prior previews and formal room saves.
- Current preview visibly loaded after restoring the local Vite service. No new use animations. Reference documentation updated in docs/room3d-bathroom.md.

2026-09-22 — Perimeter bathroom layout and four activities
- User corrected the front laundry island. Moved washer/cart/hamper against the right edge; shifted cart away from toilet approach after navigation regression. Warm-white walls now contrast with deeper gray-green tiled floor. Preview key bathroom-edge-actions-1.
- Added furniture-local 洗澡 / 泡泡浴 / 洗衣 / 坐 activities with rotation-aware collision checks, standing/seated anchors and temporary water/foam effects. Washer vibrates without modifying saved coordinates; chibi sways and nods while waiting. Classic and blank rig motions supported; no wardrobe changes.
- Completion/stop returns bath users to safe floor, restores washer, removes effects. Edit/room/furniture lifecycle follows activity validation; reduced-motion suppresses vibration/particle motion. Geometry and material resources reused and disposed.
- 19 focused tests passed; isolated production build passed with existing bundle advisory. Four actual UI action screenshots inspected in output/bathroom-actions-final; final automatic completion asserted. Separate laundry capture rechecks its state output. No new bath asset exports were required this turn.

2026-09-22 — Coat back layering and navy/brass finish
- User chose matching near-black navy body AND lapels, black belt, brass hardware. Reused canonical belt-coat and verified original geometry/UV/skin data; six small double-breasted buttons bring the asset to 2813 triangles / 4 draw calls. Published revised asset/hash/thumbnail. Explicit _lapel weight preserves independent recoloring despite equal default RGB.
- Finish sailor tuck after generic layering and hem clearance, add closed-back radial fit and whole-face coverage across the upper-arm/chest boundary; retain central opening, outer shape and cuffs. Normal six-pair back regression plus four bent-pose coat cases pass. Restoring the outfit and current rig stay unchanged.
- Browser before/after confirms back/waist improvement and separate lapel recoloring; standalone wardrobe build passes. Scoped TypeScript has only the four existing missing JS declarations. No commit/push.

2026-09-22 — Shirt/coat layering shared posed pass
- User reported remaining clipping with shirts. Reproduced large front shoulder and side-waist leaks on collar-shirt + belt-coat. Root cause: the posed finishing pass was gated to sailor tops. Renamed it fitLayeredUpperGarments, shared its shoulder/back/waist handling with collar-shirt and stand-collar, and kept the wide-collar fold exclusive to sailor tops.
- Added 16 actual-asset front/back/bent-pose combinations; six shirt-front baseline cases fail five times without this change. Before/after browser review covers front, bent back and cute side; original cuffs, central opening, outer shell, UV/weights and restoration remain tested.
- Final 111 tests in 10 files pass; standalone wardrobe build passes. Scoped tsc has the same four existing JS declaration errors. No asset/palette change, no commit/push.

2026-09-22 — Gaming study: replaced the old study desk/pouf grouping with a calibrated 15-piece streaming desk/chair setup, PC and edge-aligned storage. Black/white/sage cabinet parts rebuilt at existing dimensions (444/528 triangles), separately editable finishes, no textures. Rebuild script chained after showroom-assets. Independent study-gaming-1 preview key preserves prior saves. Showroom + gaming tests: 19 passed; isolated study production build passed (existing chunk-size warning). Game client screenshots show layout plus computer/stream interactions, no captured console errors. Study/living follow-up awaits user feedback.

2026-09-22 — Reference furnished study: added 11 geometry-only study_ref assets and a 27-item desktop layout (15 compact). Warm wood floor, large blind window, cabinet plants/printer/globe light, memo and headphone wall boards, shelf books/plants, file cart, task/floor lighting, bordered rug and entry mat. All cats and cat figurines omitted per repeated user instruction. Cabinet tops now expose supports; props and task lamp remain bound to real surfaces. First pass 22 targeted tests passed; final asset foliage change rechecks in progress. Preview key study-reference-1 keeps old saves intact.
- Final verification: 22 study/showroom/gaming tests passed, then 3 study reference tests rerun after foliage refinement; isolated production build passed with the existing size warning. Game-client computer and streaming screenshots confirm seated motions, no error logs. User preview reloaded, inspected from front and side, returned to front. No cats or cat figurines in the arrangement.

2026-09-22 — Reusable layering profiles and incremental garment acceptance
- User approved adding the earlier proposed construction metadata + automatic affected-outfit checks. All 38 catalog garments now explicitly reference wardrobeLayering.json profiles; garmentCollar, surface-shell tuck protection, whole-surface skin protection and long-skirt silhouette handling consume the shared profile lookup. Existing approved behavior/geometry remains unchanged. Asset-specific cardigan/parka skin masks and original shoe/sock seam exceptions still exist; this is not universal model classification.
- Publisher rejects missing profile registrations. Catalog/plan tests validate profile fields and slot compatibility. A real-geometry alias test proves newly registered shirt/coat IDs receive exactly the same posed correction/index results without new algorithm branches.
- pnpm wardrobe:check <IDs...> selects affected combinations dynamically, including upper + outer + representative lowerwear, onepieces, shoes/socks and accessory contexts; --all additionally runs the ten existing clothing regression files. Uses the current production loader and 48-bone rig, tests normal/boy/cute, finite posed coordinates, indices, UV/skin preservation, removal and cache restoration. Reports geometry failures separately from heuristic front/back/right-side torso visibility and fully hidden pieces. No automatic visual approval; default height/fits only, no opacity-pixel evaluation or all-motion collision proof.
- Verified 116 regressions across 11 files. Ran the complete final acceptance matrix: 369 combinations x 3 poses, zero data failures, 173 combinations flagged for prioritized visual review (these are not confirmed collisions). JSON/Markdown output: output/wardrobe-check/latest.json and latest.md. First pair-only draft checked 309; final matrix includes waistband interactions for all top profiles. Acceptance took ~265s. CLI now includes progress messages every 25 combinations; --all runs both acceptance and the separately validated regression suite.
- Wardrobe production build passed. Scoped TypeScript including the new planner/acceptance tests reports only the same four pre-existing TS7016 JS declaration errors (mirrorMotion twice, diningMotion, rhythm), no new error. Browser main tab 3 rendered successfully, current user's outfit was left untouched, console error list empty; marked deliverable. No commit/push; unrelated dirty files preserved.
- Follow-up limitation: reports intentionally leave visual acceptance pending. New/changed assets must be visually reviewed by the developer; do not claim all 369 outfits are visually clipping-free. Existing fixtures and strict geometric regressions remain useful for investigating flagged combinations.

2026-09-22 — Warm study color refinement: cream cabinet panels/device shells, olive accents, charcoal framing, desaturated warm wood floor and green monitor screen. Registered optional gaming material part controls; study instances carry overrides. Warm study-window lighting restores standard rig on room switch/overview. 3 study tests passed, production build passed, screenshot visually checked and yellow cast toned down in final pass. Preview key study-reference-warm-3.

2026-09-22 — Study detail correction: PC rotated 90 degrees and moved to z=-2.85 beside desk; warm standing light moved from left storage wall to x=-1.8/z=-2.7 beside computer. Three study layout/interaction/save tests passed; game-client screenshot checked. New isolated preview key warm-4.

2026-09-22 — Corrected PC facing per user: 270 degrees (90 was the back). Accessory organizer moved to left wall (-4.05,2.25), facing into room, with front corner plant moved to (-2.95,3.28) to avoid overlap. Memo board and storage clearance checked; 3 study tests pass. Preview warm-5.

2026-09-22 — Single-room sharing: roomSharing.js allowlists/export normalizes current-room furniture and finishes, excludes stored inventory and personal state, validates version/assets/support/placement, rekeys imported instances and preserves stored items/neighbors. Official Room and Style panels offer download/copy, paste/file preview, explicit apply, immediate edit/undo. Existing whole-home backup labels clarified. Textareas excluded from scene key shortcuts. Six sharing/study tests and final fixture build passed; real browser download/clipboard/paste apply/undo/file preview verified, screenshot checked at desktop and user narrow viewport. User left in arrange mode. Documentation: docs/room3d-sharing.md.

2026-09-22 — User approved their exported study layout as the default. Updated six furniture poses; archived exact supplied JSON in sources/showrooms/study-approved-layout.json. All 27 poses/colors/support/dock links match the approved export; 7 study/showroom tests pass. Opened existing living showroom for next review.

2026-09-22 — Reference living room: 25 editable items, 14 new geometry-only assets, oak/cream/sage finishes, window-side sofa and left media wall, supported ornaments and preserved compact template. Assets remain below 4000 triangles, sofa seats inherited. External curtain window reach 5.8 with warm lighting. 10 targeted tests and fixture production build passed (existing chunk-size advisory). Real UI seating confirmed, daylight inspected, both viewpoints checked; current living preview refreshed for user. No commit/push.

2026-09-22 — Retired handmade fitting idles; sourced CC0 replacement
- User requested removing the two ugly wardrobe presentation motions and researching open animation libraries, mentioning VRoid. Removed boy/cute from the production menu and their procedural/entrance generation from production wardrobePose.ts; old persisted values safely resolve to the approved normal stance. Original motions moved ONLY to test/fixtures/legacyWardrobePose.ts so clothing stress tests retain their prior coverage.
- Researched primary sources: VRoid official 7-motion VRMA pack includes fitting/showcase poses but restricts extractable redistribution; not imported. Quaternius pack page says CC0 while current general license says QAL (2026-08-28), so avoided an unverified new download. Mesh2Motion explicitly publishes animation assets as CC0; pinned repository revision 3ce7f9d97d25e608b4779ce797da343775ded62b and downloaded human-base-animations.glb with SHA256 406eb0a8dc4ab366e623b79b6e3005a4951392e1bda78ae39c1099d31147733c.
- Evaluated Idle_A and Idle_ShakeOff in actual 48-bone/approved-clothing preview at three timestamps. Kept only low-amplitude Idle_A (3.125s) as new optional 自然待机, preserving 普通站姿 default. Generated 64 KB wardrobeMotions.json via reproducible hash-checked import-wardrobe-motions.mjs: GLTFLoader/Mixer, T-pose world rotation deltas, mapped spine hierarchy; no external humanoid mesh or new skin weights. Existing finger curl and forearm twist distribution retained. Licensing/source notes in docs/chibi-motion-sources.md and art/chibi/motion-sources/Mesh2Motion-LICENSE-CC0.md.
- 41 targeted motion/swap/shoulder layering tests pass; confirms retired-value fallback, loop endpoints, quaternion normalization, actual animation movement and no mutation of live rig during clip creation. Wardrobe build passes. Scoped TS still only four pre-existing JS declaration errors. Current acceptance command now includes normal + imported idle + two retired test-only stress poses; collar-shirt incremental run: 20 combinations, zero data failures, 16 heuristic review flags (not visual approval).
- CUA main wardrobe: dropdown contains only normal and natural idle; selected new idle, visually checked real character/outfit, same data-body-id before/after, no console errors, pause works. Return preview to normal and resume playback after verification. Temporary motion QA tab closed. No commit/push, no unrelated file cleanup.

2026-09-22 — Live audition of eight open animation candidates
- User explicitly requested more candidates to choose in the wardrobe. Expanded the same pinned CC0 Mesh2Motion source via wardrobeMotionCatalog.json: Idle_A, Idle_FoldArms, Idle_ShakeOff, Idle_Talking, Idle_TalkingPhone, Yes, Interact, Dance_Simple. Chinese menu numbers 1–8; approved normal stance retained. These are audition candidates, not user-approved final motions; phone gesture has no phone prop.
- Added previous/next/replay controls next to the motion menu. New selections and replay start from the clip beginning, resume playback, and retain the live character/garments. Non-loop gestures append a 0.45s return to their first frame for preview repetition without editing the original segment. Retired handmade boy/cute stay unavailable in production.
- Generator remains pinned/hash checked; output now 441969 bytes. 15 motion/swap tests pass across all candidates, covering finite normalized quaternion tracks, actual movement and replay boundaries. Production wardrobe build passes; scoped TS has only the same four pre-existing missing JS declarations.
- Browser verified the numbered 8-choice list, next to #2 抱臂站立, replay, unchanged body ID, no console errors, and compact viewport controls. User is actively changing clothing in the live tab; left their choices intact and left tab 3 open/marked deliverable. Do not automatically cycle or reset their ongoing choices. No commit/push.

2026-09-22 — Imported user Meshy living collection (5,824,736 bytes, 8,621 triangles, 1 material, 3 images); archived clean geometry only. Extracted cat tree, replaced fused upper/middle perch web with closed round platforms and a bowl, retained separate posts; final 1,619 triangles, cream/sage/rope materials, no images/UV/colors. `living-cat-tree.mjs` regenerates from clean archived source. Living window now declares a recessed wallOpening; shell wall and wallpaper cut matching apertures, derived from placements. Existing ordinary windows unchanged. 17 targeted tests passed; source/repaired closeups and room screenshots inspected. Preview key living-reference-2.

2026-09-22 — User chose Japanese cute / gentle small motions after rejecting Mesh2Motion style.
- Researched original BOOTH author pages for Sachi VRMA 1 (sashii, CC0) and the rerofumi VRMA pack (CC0). Direct downloads require login; obtained idle-01, speaking-01, pose-motion from the public VoxAvatar redistribution pinned to 3061a25dc9c9fa0660e2fc59c50b50f019c5129c, verified all three manifest SHA256 hashes.
- Added hash-checked import-vrma-wardrobe.mjs and separate wardrobeVrmaMotions.json. Uses VRMC humanoid semantic mapping, world rest rotation deltas and upperChest folding; keeps existing 48-bone geometry, weights, finger curl and wrist twist. Source expressions/root translations/finger animation are not imported. Old Mesh2Motion generator skips new provider entries and cannot overwrite VRMA output.
- Inspected source skeleton beside front/side/back target figures in .tmp/motion-research/vrma-preview.html, including idle/chat middle frames and pose-motion at 20/50/80%. Added three audition choices (not user-approved finals): 轻轻待机 7.97s, 轻声交谈 1.97s, 转身小手势 19.97s. Grouped as 轻柔候选, with prior eight retained separately for comparison.
- 18 motion/swap tests pass; wardrobe production build passes. Scoped TS only the same four pre-existing missing JS declarations. Live wardrobe tab 3 left on new 轻轻待机, replay verified, identical data-body-id, no browser errors. Did not change user clothing or character settings. QA tab closed; live tab marked deliverable. No commit/push.

2026-09-22 — Investigated animation clipping, leg white lines and disappearing skin (research + bounded fix).
- User explicitly requested researching comparable products/open source, rather than guessing. Reviewed primary ZEPETO rigging/masking, VRoid Skin Masks, MPFB ClothesService conservative masking/surface correspondence, Roblox layered cages/AFT animation checks, and three-mesh-bvh skinned geometry support. Findings/limitations recorded in docs/chibi-layering.md.
- Reproduced exact items in .tmp/motion-research/clipping.html with four synchronized views: stand-collar + slouch-cardigan + sailor-shorts + original socks/shoes; comparisons remove socks, remove shoes, restore unmasked body. At library-idle 30%, fine thigh cracks disappear when restoring original skin. Root cause: subdivision of masked body edges interpolates bind coordinates/weights and creates nonconforming posed edges. Changed body and sock/boot boundary clipping in approvedClothing.ts to conservative whole original faces (-Infinity preserve threshold), leaving source positions/weights untouched. Same frame now has no fine thigh cracks.
- Added clothingMaskMotion.test.ts using shipped lowerwear and actual animation samples: no generated body vertices, every retained face is original, retained skin deforms identically to original body, masking still removes covered faces, removal restores body. 77 tests passed across mask motion, wardrobe swap, original wardrobe, garment fit/layering/collar. Wardrobe build passed; no browser errors.
- IMPORTANT REMAINING: original shoe/sock ankle notch under bent natural idle still exists (normal stance closes it). Restoring all body fills background holes but makes skin poke through cloth, so that is not a valid blanket fix. Stand-collar/cardigan still has substantial inner/outer clipping, including reference stance with default fit. Existing static mask/tuck and fixed collar pose do not guarantee animation coverage. No speculative per-frame solver, cage system or wholesale reweighting was added. Full animation/outfit interaction tests are needed; earlier quaternion/loop checks were insufficient visual acceptance.
- User live tab 3 retained unchanged motion/outfit (library-idle, original socks), marked deliverable; temporary diagnostic tab 7 closed. Source/diagnostic files remain for continuing work. No commit/push.

2026-09-22 — Animated wardrobe clipping repair (continued)
- User authorized implementation after ZEPETO / MPFB / VRoid / Roblox / CC research. Kept conservative original-face body and sock masks; retained-skin motion regression prevents interpolation cracks.
- Diagnosed original shoe/sock medial holes as four open loops introduced by separating touching legs. Added 30 Earcut triangles using existing vertices/weights; republished original-outfit.glb and both revision manifests. No outer silhouette/cuff changes.
- Added garmentMotionFit using existing three-mesh-bvh StaticGeometryGenerator/refit. Moving chest-space local depth constraints, bounded original-vertex updates, independent cuff/front-opening protection, baseline recomputation, unchanged outer/body/weights. Wired updatePose through wardrobe preview and visitor; fixed pause sampling to freeze its current time.
- New real-asset regressions cover five poses, root transforms, no accumulated corrections, cache/disposal, transparency, footwear boundary closure. In chest-space front contact samples: 55→1 normal, 160→15 library idle, 55→1 Sachi idle, 51→0 speaking, 31→3 Fumi gesture. Residual edge contacts remain; not full cloth simulation.
- Adaptive triangle sampling avoids repeated BVH queries within solver passes. Browser warm correction median ~14 ms on current machine. Visually compared front/side/back and without shoes/socks; kept user's real wardrobe unchanged. Build passed; scoped TS still has four pre-existing JS declaration errors only.
- Final verification: pnpm wardrobe:check --all passed all 137 tests / 15 files. 369 combinations × 4 poses: zero data failures, 173 review flags (not all visually certified). Wardrobe production build passed. User page motion switches kept body UUID unchanged; no browser errors.
- Final dev-only HMR edit emitted React duplicate-createRoot warning from the existing wardrobe entry. Clean reloaded the preview to remove the stale hot-reload state; production build is unaffected. No unrelated entry-point rewrite.

2026-09-22 — Added four coordinated room themes plus sage baseline: lilac, blush, aqua, cyber. Decoration panel applies furniture material roles with wall/floor/trim in one undoable commit; room expansion permits theme selection before adding a showroom. 121 assets registered from actual material names, preserving wood/foliage/glass. Four room layouts x five themes pass save/share/pose invariants; 5 palette/sharing tests pass, fixture build passes. Four real UI theme screenshots inspected, no console errors. User preview currently shows pink theme selected by user; preserve it.

2026-09-23 — Palette refinement per user: cyber renamed 电竞黑白紫; pale walls/floor, white cabinet wood replacements, charcoal tables/frames, lilac accents. Registered woodLight/walnut/gold/rope controls explicitly; other palettes remove these overrides to restore original wood. Blush/aqua accents lighter and less saturated. 6 palette/sharing tests passed, pink plus blue/cyber visual screenshots checked. Preview service recovered after host suspension; restarted Vite on 5173. Live preview set to revised black/white/purple. No user layout changes.

2026-09-23 — Added narrow-stance motion auditions after user preferred the earlier group and requested MMD alternatives.
- Obtained DiSK Eyedart & Breath v1.1 from the original BowlRoll page (231043), verified archive SHA1 against author page and read packaged CC0 permission. Included only 47 KB Breath_1800F.vmd + original readme; no model, preview video, or eye animation. Offline mmd-parser dev dependency handles VMD parsing/handedness; importer preserves destination-key Bezier rotation timing and composes seven tracks onto approved standing pose.
- Screened nine Overte/Hanami VRMA clips on current rig. Selected nod, neckstretch and lookaround; pinned Hanami 6787685c8d40e4e79bffbb0d389b478f32ef88d6, recorded hashes, NOTICE and Apache-2.0 license. Reused VRMA importer with optional hash manifest.
- Added choices 12–17 in 新候选 · 窄站姿: MMD breathing, original Idle_A / Talking upper-body narrow variants, gentle nod, neck relaxation and lookaround. Pelvis/legs use approved neutral pose, no translations or changed weights. Original eleven remain unchanged. Variants are for standing only, not a generic locomotion retargeter.
- 30 motion/import tests pass (including 121-time foot stability samples for six candidates), existing 6 garmentMotionFit tests pass, production wardrobe build passes. Scoped TypeScript retains four existing missing JS declaration errors only. Initial pnpm vitest shim not found; invoked existing vitest via pnpm node. Disabled result cache to avoid sandbox EPERM writing node_modules cache. MMD 5-degree assertion tolerance adjusted for source's actual 4.99496-degree float.
- Browser inspected current rig + sailor long/cardigan/shorts/original shoes+socks at start, quarter-front, half-side and three-quarter-back, no errors. Minor sleeve contact remains on original natural idle variant; not a full cloth collision certification. User was already selecting new option 16 in live tab 3, so preserved live outfit/motion and did not reload or save their draft. Documentation: docs/chibi-motion-sources.md. No commit/push.

2026-09-23 — User selected motion numbers 1, 12, 14, 16, 17 for retention.
- Added approvedWardrobeMotions.json as explicit retained list with fixed audition numbers. UI now shows these five in 已选动作 plus normal stance. Archived source clips remain available for clothing regression; unselected saved UI values fall back to normal.
- Added art/chibi/motion-sources/SELECTED-CREDITS.md with per-clip author/project, original file, primary page, pinned source/mirror, hashes, license copies, modifications and ready-to-use credits. docs/chibi-motion-sources.md now leads with the confirmed selection, superseding historical candidate status.
- User clarified NEXT work is two-person interactions (双人互动), and explicitly said 先等会. Do not begin interaction research or implementation until the user resumes. Current task is only retaining choices and provenance.

2026-09-23 — Added isolated showroom gallery at test/fixtures/room3d-gallery.html. Orders living, bedroom, study, kitchen, bathroom in responsive grid, five palette choices, real canvas previews and room detail modal. Sequentially mounts/disposes one renderer for thumbnails, caches in memory; never loads or writes existing room saves. Browser game-client confirms all five thumbnails ready, no runtime errors; gallery screenshot inspected.

2026-09-23 — Fixed rectangular school-sock cuff artifacts; made height growth leg-dominant.
- User repro: school-socks recolored #929398, length 117%, narrow-talk; live height later confirmed 119%. Source cuff y=.96 and its weights are level, so the blocky silhouette came from exposed skin crossing an undersized sock after length adjustment, including coarse edge interiors.
- Added fitSockSurface after tailoring, only for school-socks. Reuses MeshBVH to fit shaft vertices and face samples around the actual calf, keeps y/rim/topology/UV, transfers skin barycentric weights at the NEW location, retains complete boundary faces, does not hide extra skin. Initial vertex-only fix left small edge intersections; final four bounded face-sample passes clear them. Actual asset tests cover 100/117/135% sock length at 80/100/125% body height, both rim vertices and edge middles, normalized weights, shoes/removal.
- Added shared bodyHeightY/bodyBaseY/bodyHeightSlope mapping: feet unchanged, leg growth 1.65x parameter delta, torso ~0.385x; about 84% added ankle-to-neck height in legs, same neck-height endpoint and unchanged face scale. Updated body/normals, rig anchors, hair head anchor, original hoodie, approved clothes/rest mapping, inverse-space tailoring/masking, hem anchor, posed-inner-fit eligibility, seated pelvis and shoe lift. Default h=1 identity. BodyControls explains new behavior.
- Validation: full wardrobe check 142 tests/15 files, 369 outfits x 4 poses, 0 data failures / 173 existing visual review flags. Final sock face refinement additionally passed 21 tests/5 files including cuff/edge clearance, proportions, motion and mask boundaries. Wardrobe build passed; scoped TS retains only four pre-existing missing JS declarations. Separate blankRig test hits its stale <=4000 face budget against existing 6136-face body; body data was not modified, chibiBodyGeometry <=6500 test passes. Left that unrelated assertion unchanged.
- Browser compared three heights, front and 55-degree side at motion midpoint with school socks 117%, then confirmed flat gray sock rims on live user's page. During dev HMR, existing duplicate-createRoot/removeChild issue caused a preview remount/randomized unsaved appearance; outfit draft survived. Informed user; did not click Save or reload. Live tab 3 left on Body controls at original 119% height and 104% head, narrow-talk. QA tab 12 closed. No commits/push. Double-person interaction work remains paused at user's request.

2026-09-23 — 厨房版本缺失待找回（用户要求暂缓）
- 用户确认原先已完成黑色厨房及「泡咖啡」动作，当前精装房总览误用早期厨房模板，不能视作已验收版本。
- 线索：2026-09-20 周日另一任务，用户记得可能与手绘贴图水手服和穿衣动作一起拉取；尚未核实。当前代码/存档/可访问任务记录/远端分支/Git 旧对象及 fe5abfc8、ddbab23e 中未定位到，不能断言丢失。
- 用户明确「先这样吧，记下来少了厨房」。停止查找和恢复，未覆盖厨房，不以重新涂黑冒充恢复。持久待办见 docs/room3d-showrooms.md「待找回：已调整的黑色厨房」。
- 用户随后纠正：不是仅缺黑色布局或「泡咖啡」，而是厨房系列少了很多动作。按用户原话正式标记「厨房系列遗失」，范围包含原布局与多项动作；泡咖啡仅为已知例子，其他动作清单待找回。文档标题已同步更正，继续暂缓恢复。

2026-09-23 — 厨房系列从远端找回并合入
- 用户补交 02581af6（furnished kitchen, coffee corner and kitchen activities）；已从 ddbab23e 快进拉入。解除「厨房系列遗失」标记，docs/room3d-showrooms.md 已改为已找回并记录真实来源。
- 通过 autostash 保全本地改动；人工合并厨房与卧室镜子/浴室动作、体型适配、参考布局、分享配色、素材目录的交叉修改。未回退其他房间，保留原厨房存档键 showrooms-preview-storage-kitchen。保留恢复备份 stash 和 .tmp/before-kitchen-restore.patch；恢复原本未暂存状态，不额外提交或推送。
- 恢复咖啡萃取/拿杯、取盘/去水槽/洗碗/返回放盘、灶台煮饭及原黑白布局，冰箱与用餐旧功能保留。总览五间房均能渲染，已检查 output/kitchen-restored-gallery/shot-0.png 和咖啡/洗碗动作截图。
- 17 份相关测试共 65 项通过（厨房、功能区、样板房、镜子、浴室、配色分享、体型动作和其他房间回归）；样板房生产构建通过，保留体积提示。原装饰测试引用已移除温泉/旧材质白名单，已同步成当前厨房样式和未知材质拒绝检查。实际厨房全流程 QA 仍在执行，首次曾因场景导航 30 秒超时中断，已改为可配置地址与 120 秒 DOM 加载等待后重跑。
- 浏览器 QA 最终已输出完整报告 output/showrooms/kitchen-actions-qa.json：咖啡、洗碗六阶段往返、煮饭均完成；休息及收纳水槽中断均清理正确，errors 为空。报告写出后进程关闭缓慢，发送中断结束会话（退出码 1）；功能断言已全部执行通过。

2026-09-23 — Restored kitchen one-click furniture palettes
- Extended semantic palette roles for kitchen materials, porcelain and charcoal; registered kitchenware assets too. Kitchen bench and mats use accents; preserves plants, food, glass and steel. All five existing room palette buttons now cover the recovered kitchen series; no placement/action changes.
- Regenerated catalog palette controls (177 assets). 14 palette/sharing/kitchen-action tests passed, including restored coffee machine/fridge/runner/bench and save validation. Browser aqua/cyber preview verification in progress.
- Browser UI aqua/cyber palette switching completed with clean exit and no error artifact; inspected both actual renders in output/kitchen-palettes/shot-0.png and shot-1.png. New coffee/shelf/appliance materials and bench/rug accents visibly follow themes, cyber has neutral wood surfaces. User's live saved room was not modified by the isolated QA.

2026-09-24 — User PSD split face + textured back hair
- Published 77 authored layers from D:/Downloads/6_0_29201.psd using ag-psd + sharp; PSD left untouched. SHA-256 and source-layer traceability in faceAssets.json. Four back1 PNG replacements retain existing creator IDs/tinting; removed the 3D exterior's solid-color overpaint, retaining the inner liner.
- Added independent face settings/compositor and head-panel controls: 7 upper lashes (04 is pupil-free squint), paired iris/sclera open+half, common closed and authored happy-closed, four brows with native C/D slope preserved, seven highlights, 12 grouped mouths, custom pupils/highlights. A/B confirmation from user: eye upper edge tucks into the main lash stroke; iris+sclera share one translation, with manual offset after auto alignment.
- User follow-up: highlight TOP should stay BELOW lash and be visible. Highlight now independently fits the visible iris, preferring translation at original size, then uniform scale only if aperture is too short. Keeps authored horizontal position when possible; final iris/lid clip still applies. source-atop avoids thickening alpha edges.
- Face updates do not rebuild the model or restart motions; body UUID unchanged in browser across styles/states/manual adjustment. Motion cannot overwrite selected split-face states; optional blink separate. Visitor reads saved face settings. Existing no-face saves retain legacy appearance. New wardrobe drafts default to split face; enabled it in current test draft through UI, did not click Save.
- Added unsaved appearance draft persistence and reused React root across entry HMR to stop development reloads rerolling the avatar. Current draft has red hair / dark skin, existing clothes retained.
- Validation: 10 tests pass (chibiFace + wardrobeSwap); real browser fixture /test/fixtures/chibi-face.html reports 28 previews and 29 pixel checks, including closed-eye exclusion, visible highlights in open/half, oversized custom detail clipping. Inspected unoccluded contact sheet and real 3D front/back; no runtime console errors. Preview production build passes, existing large-bundle warning. Scoped TypeScript only has the same four pre-existing missing declaration errors for mirrorMotion/diningMotion/rhythm JS.
- Documentation: docs/chibi-face-textures.md, linked from PSD pipeline doc. No commit/push, APP_VERSION untouched, unrelated room/chat edits preserved. Vite on 127.0.0.1:5173 restarted (initial old page had fetch failure).

2026-09-24 — Sclera contour correction + lower automatic iris baseline
- User rejected fixed paired sclera PNGs: new diagram defines A/D at eyelid ends and B/C along lower iris. Default white now starts with iris alpha and adds smooth side regions bounded by lid A→D, D→C, iris lower edge C→B, B→A; authored white PNGs retained only for provenance. Recomputes when style/state/manual offset changes. Lower-lash height migration now uses iris, not unused white metadata.
- Verified PSD 05/正常 and 05/半睁 against exported iris-05-open/half pixel-by-pixel: both exactly match, no style swap.
- User further requested automatic eyes 9px lower. Added +9 original-artwork pixels to auto alignment, preserving manual offset as a separate addition. Current main preview has manual eye offset 0; user's other selections left alone (upper06 / iris01, motion17, custom highlight03, smile02, blink on).
- 7 face tests pass, including all 72 open/half lid/iris combinations' contour anchors and manual movement. Browser contact sheet: 28 previews, 29 pixel checks pass; reviewed rows 01–07 and actual main preview. Scoped TS still only the four existing JS declarations errors.

## 2026-09-24 捏脸引导与细调
- 视觉方向：沿用暖白与灰紫，角色保持主画面；右侧一次只编辑一个部件。内容顺序：确认形象/体型类型 → 脸部 → 衣橱 → 比例；交互使用头部特写切换、轻量分页过渡、顶部折叠微调。
- 自动眼珠对齐 +9 调回 +4；新独立部件大小/宽窄/上下，整体眼距；位图和遮罩共享变换。
- 嘴型三用途独立保存并迁移旧值，默认闭嘴，试看只影响预览。基础编辑复用 CreatorRollBridge captureOnly。
- 已通过 13 项单测、28 个真实合成预览及 37 项像素检查、衣橱预览构建。Scoped TS 仍报原有 mirrorMotion/diningMotion/rhythm JS 声明缺失，未出现本次新增错误。
- 独立浏览器交互验收通过：闭嘴 closed-03 / 说话 open-02 / 笑 smile-08 各自保持；眼珠上下、宽窄变更时模型 UUID 不变；打开/完成基础形象后回到工坊，嘴型仍保留；控制台无 error。顶部整体微调收为两行，完整眼型缩略图已视觉检查。

## 2026-09-24 原画眼部配准修正
- 用户指出 01–07 是直接从原画拆分，默认位置应保留。检查确认上睫毛位图仍使用原 472px 坐标；原算法却把原生眼珠再次 A/B 对齐（01 +8px、06 +14px、05 −9px）。
- eyePairOffset 改为保留每款/每种开合的原生睫毛—眼珠间距，同款未微调时严格偏移 0；混搭和缩放才补偿差值。取消全局 +4 补偿，保留用户手动微调。
- 9 项单测通过，覆盖全部 72 个睫毛/眼珠开合组合，匹配款式零偏移及手动微调叠加。

## 2026-09-24 默认眼型完整还原及 06/07 半睁
- 修正前一轮仅检查位移的不足：原款默认睁眼使用之前完整贴图的原位置/轮廓，并继承各款原生眉毛与高光；07 原款无高光。
- 新增原款源数据、离线发布器和可追溯派生眉毛/高光素材；不更改旧眼睛贴图或源 PSD。
- 同款半睁使用配套眼白，固定眼睛下缘，不叠加眼珠底部上缩与上睫毛下移；混搭仍可自动配准/重建。
- 点击原款编号清理旧眼部补偿与覆盖，保留嘴型；颜色和部件仍可编辑。
- 14 项单测、28 个状态预览和 44 项像素检查通过，含 7 款旧原图逐像素 alpha/位置/轮廓对照。Scoped TS 仍仅原有 4 个 JS 类型声明问题。

## 2026-09-29 眼部原位置组合、统一染色与六款白色高光
- 用户要求暂时取消眼睛必须跟随睫毛位置的自动组合，使用原始画布坐标；核对拆分灰度染色差异，并照原 01–07 整理六款白色高光。
- 查明原完整眼型局部 65% 混色与拆分眼珠整层 65% 叠色不一致。新增共享 faceTint，复用旧 applyEyesTint 的 HSL/黑白保护/柔和过渡规则；原图空间染色后才变换，完整图中覆盖虹膜的睫毛排除染色。
- 取消 eyePairOffset、半睁下缘补偿、下睫毛跟随眼珠位移、以及高光自动贴齐/缩放；按原 PNG 坐标和独立手动微调绘制，保留可见虹膜裁切与闭眼隐藏。
- 从原 01/02/03/05/06/07 提取六款纯白高光（classic-01..06），过滤眼白边缘；07 只有下方淡灰亮点，转白作为第六款，不改原款默认。来源/哈希、可重复发布脚本已保存。新菜单显示六款并用灰紫底展示白色；旧 PSD 款收在“其他高光”，旧设置仍有效。
- 验证：14 项单测通过；灰阶 0–255 直接与旧 HTML applyEyesTint 对照。浏览器 156 项原位置检查 / 274039 个可见源像素通过；28 个状态预览 / 44 项像素检查通过。六款菜单、换色、眼珠/高光上下滑杆、换睫毛保留手调、睁眼/半睁/闭眼切换均通过，body UUID 未变，页面错误为空。
- 检查真实截图 .tmp/face-native-verified/shot-0.png、.tmp/face-native-ui.png 和全状态预览。衣橱预览生产构建通过，仅原有包体提示。开发服务在 127.0.0.1:5173；已请求在应用侧打开衣橱页。未提交/推送；未改用户草稿。原位置的半睁效果留待用户挑选，不自行恢复自动补偿。

## 2026-09-29 固定测试角色 + 样板房双体型对照
- 用户要求先逐间查看样板房，让原版 Chibi 与二号素体同房，作为后续房间动作适配基准。本轮先搭建对照场景，不宣称已完成所有动作适配或双人互动。
- 新入口 test/fixtures/room3d-body-comparison.html。固定角色小栗：明确部件选择、栗棕头发、绿眼睛，复用同一分层图给两种身体，刷新不随机。五间房顺序为客厅/卧室/书房/厨房/浴室，使用内存模板，不读写用户房屋或外观草稿。
- 编辑器新增可选双角色对照接口，当前体型沿用真实家具动作，另一只在安全空地等待。换人停止动作/道具并站立，模型 UUID 不变；等待者作为导航障碍，地图随布置变化缓存失效，销毁释放两只角色。
- 浏览器发现并修复骨骼对象换父级时旧 bindMatrixInverse/包围盒导致 3.3 错误头宽、无法落地而消失的问题：测量前更新 world matrix + skeleton，并重算 skinned bounding box。增加带缩放和换父级的真实骨骼回归测试。
- 验证：16 项房间/厨房/浴室/等待占地单测通过，随后新增骨骼回归的 3 项对照测试通过；五间房双方可见、反复切换不重建、家具数据不变，客厅双方真实点击沙发试坐通过，切换退出坐姿，page errors 为空。报告 .tmp/room-comparison-report.json；已看客厅、浴室、试坐截图。预览独立生产构建检查中。
- 下一步：用户从客厅起逐项看接触姿势，再根据具体反馈调整二号动作。未提交/推送，先前五官修改保留。
- 补充验收：双体型对照页独立生产构建通过（5.13s）；应用侧已请求打开客厅对照页。

## 2026-09-29 二号独立客厅动作第一组
- 用户确认二号应有自己的动作，先落地客厅坐下/起身/走路/浇水，不复制圆团手脚轨迹。新增 roomMotionFrame/seatChange，用现有 48 骨 FK 与手部挂点编写，无新增外部动作素材；此前五段试衣动作和来源保持不变。
- 坐位前检测空地，1.05s 屈膝前倾进入/离开接触点；无空间或 reduced motion 时保持旧静态姿势。尚未做远处走到座位的完整入座旅程。行走低幅摆臂、屈膝脚踝配合，二号速度 1.05；浇水抬壶/倾倒/收壶共享阶段，真实右手带动水壶，双腕距离修正到约 .294 房间单位，倾倒才出水。
- 分开二号头部和躯干的导航高度，浇水增加斜向候选。客厅龟背竹可用，墙角枝叶树仍因空间不足不可用。头顶改按实际角色与头发包围盒测量；小栗约 2.45，旧门净高 2.35，不能直立穿门：后续需低头屈膝过门，未缩小角色/改家具。
- 增加近座/浇水俯视近景；相机不打断过渡。动作/换人/布置取消时清理姿势与道具，修复半蹲停留。原版壶位和步速不变。
- 22 项单测通过（三档身高骨长/有效矩阵/中断恢复、座位变换、道具阶段、分层碰撞与原有家具交互）；当前对照页生产构建通过 4.45s。技能 Playwright client 运行并检查截图。实际家具点击验证二号坐下/起身、浇水结束/中断、半途换人/进入布置；房内点地走动并停止单独复测通过，页面错误为空。
- 近景截图已查：.tmp/living-sit-mid.png、living-seated.png、living-rise-mid.png、living-water.png、living-walk.png。浏览器脚本 .tmp/living-motion-qa.mjs（最初误用低门洞作行走目标，现改为房内地板），末项实际通过 .tmp/living-walk-final.mjs。图像检查发现第一次左右手隔太宽后已校准。
- 下一步由用户验收客厅动作，再做卧室/书房/厨房/浴室，以及二号低门洞的低头通行。并非全房间动作已完成。未提交/推送，之前五官和双体型对照工作保留。

2026-09-29 — Body 2 flower-cushion sitting
- User simplified the proposal: forward, parallel relaxed legs with level feet; no side folding. Explicit floor profile only for bedroom_ref_flower_pouf; classic/sofa unchanged and 172% scale preserved.
- Separate 2.2s entry/rise and persistent seat context; Three CCDIKSolver reused for ground/hand contact, with virtual targets outside the shipped skeleton. Reach adapts to real leg length. Visitor exposes inner seatScale to convert room units correctly.
- 25 targeted tests and comparison Vite production build passed. Browser captures .tmp/floor-front.png, floor-side.png, floor-lower.png, floor-rise.png; skill loop .tmp/floor-final-skill.
- Other seat assets still need explicit pose registration and visual review; no general cloth collision, no imported external motion asset, and walk-to-seat remains a separate future step.

2026-09-29 — Cushion resting hands follow-up
- User requested both hands naturally at the sides. Removed floor-seat lap-reaching overrides; reuse the relaxed hip-side arm pose. The temporary right-hand support gesture blends from/to that same rest pose.

2026-09-29 — Live comparison character size slider
- Added per-actor size control next to body switch: classic 100% / body2 172% defaults, reset button. Values survive room/actor switches within this fixture session; user data is untouched.
- setScaleMultiplier updates the existing hierarchy and navigation heights; dynamic seatScale keeps cushion contact conversion correct. Editor refreshes clearance without rebuilding actors or changing camera zoom.
- Browser QA .tmp/size-slider-qa.mjs passed UUID/camera stability, seated resize, independent actor values/reset and mobile no-overflow; inspected screenshots .tmp/size-slider-room.png and size-slider-mobile.png. 9 related tests and fixture production build passed.

2026-09-29 — User chose 200% as the provisional body-2 home default
- Updated NEW_BODY_HOME_PERCENT from 172 to 200; comparison initial/reset values follow it. Classic stays 100%. Slider lower multiplier permits its existing 90% endpoint against the new baseline.
- Validation: 9 motion/comparison checks passed at the updated floor-seat scale; browser confirmed 200% initial/reset values, live resize and actor-switch independence.

2026-09-29 — Body 2 bedroom actions
- Registered a reviewed show_bed-only rest profile: actual crown-to-hip distance positions the head inside the pillow region, with pelvis-centered 2.6s recline/rise, legs extended above the mattress and hands relaxed at the sides. Default 200% and original bone lengths preserved; other beds keep their previous behavior.
- Fixed split-face sleeping precedence; eyes close once reclined and open while rising. Interrupted rise + resize returns to the valid bed rest pose; switching actors resets standing without rebuilding either model.
- Turned new-bedroom dresser and supported mirror toward the room (270 degrees), using body-specific vertical clearance and navigation-safe approach points. Comparison spectator avoids mirror/wardrobe endpoints.
- Found wardrobe endpoint rounding into furniture despite the precise point being safe. Navigation now connects precise endpoints to reachable adjacent grid nodes; collision checks remain. Browser verified both wardrobe/mirror round trips use walking, no teleport fallback, with body-2 speed 1.05.
- Validation: 30 initial targeted tests, then 44 navigation/layout/mirror regression tests passed (overlapping suites); comparison production build passed. Browser .tmp/bedroom-full-qa.mjs and bedroom-right-qa.mjs verified left/right rest, entry/rise, resize interruption, actor reset, stable UUIDs, dresser and outfit route without page errors. Reviewed entry, recline, sleep front/side, rise, right bed and dresser screenshots.
- Scope: bed transition starts at a safe bedside point; distant approach/full climb is not implemented. Bench with cat/books still has no seat, flower pouf reuses approved forward-leg pose. No new external animation assets; no new general cloth collision or toon-material conversion. Prior wardrobe/facial work preserved; no commit/push.

2026-09-29 — User rejected the sleep look; prefer existing open motion assets
- User wants room actions assembled from open animation libraries rather than more authored FK motions. Current bed pose is explicitly unapproved/placeholder despite functional tests; preserve selected wardrobe five clips and credits.
- Researched primary sources: Overte/Hanami Apache-2.0 slow/normal walks, turns, starts/stops with exact filenames; sashii's CC0 Walk/SlowRun/Run conversion of Jen Jell's Josie (both author pages verified); inspected pinned Mesh2Motion GLB for Walk, Walk_Formal, Walk_Carry and sitting clips as fallback. Do not infer sleep from LayToIdle filename.
- Recorded candidates and asset-first policy in docs/chibi-motion-sources.md. No new assets downloaded/imported this turn, no runtime replacement claimed. Sleep candidate remains unverified; next implementation should audition source clips on body 2, preserve root/foot contacts and attribution.

2026-09-29 — Four source walking cycles available for live selection
- User requested direct integration. Imported pinned Hanami/Overte world-walk-slow and world-walk (Apache-2.0, hashes checked), plus existing pinned Mesh2Motion Walk and Walk_Formal (CC0). Reused the VRMA and GLB retarget generators; GLB generator accepts optional output/catalog without changing its wardrobe defaults. Exact sources, hashes, modifications and commands: art/chibi/motion-sources/ROOM-WALK-CREDITS.md.
- Fixture buttons 1–4 switch body 2 to an in-place audition, with author/license links, stop and a navigation-backed short-walk button. Choices survive room switches in the page; no saved character/house changes. Normal app keeps previous walk unless a clip is explicitly assigned; generated audition data only imported by the fixture.
- Clip sampler preserves source full-body rotations and cadence, uses existing finger/twist adaptation. Lower ankle is returned to the standing plane; room movement speed estimated from target rig stride and current world scale. This is not a full foot-lock IK/cloth collision solution. No new sleep/start/stop asset was imported. Sashii download requires BOOTH login, so not listed as playable.
- Verified 11 motion tests including three body heights, all four cycles, fixed bone lengths, finite matrices, ankle contact and idle restoration. Browser checks compare candidate screenshots at two phases, stable actor UUIDs, stop and actual travel. Initial QA caught focusResident cancelling preview and residual vertical blending; both fixed before final checks.
- Final browser QA passed all four switches, actual navigation movement/arrival, stop, actor reuse and mobile no-overflow. Inspected .tmp/walk-candidate-*.png, walk-mobile.png and walk-final-skill/shot-0.png. Skill client reused with a longer click-ready timeout for model loading. Final comparison production build passed. No commit/push; user now chooses 1–4 in the existing room comparison page.

2026-09-29 — User chose candidate 2: 日常走路
- Promoted the exact Overte world-walk clip to approvedRoomWalk.json and made it the default for body-2 visitors in every room. Classic remains unchanged. Comparison default is now 2 with 已选为默认 status; other candidates are temporary comparisons.
- Updated selected credits and source records; Apache license, NOTICE and upstream Hanami conversion notice are included under public/room3d/motions for distribution. Sleep is still unapproved. No character saves or remote changes.

2026-09-30 — User Meshy motion pack audition
- Inspected user-supplied Meshy_AI_current_body_unrigged_biped.zip: 14 GLBs, 15 animation clips, all with 28-joint Meshy skins. Original user body shape is retained in the exports, but this is not the project's 48-joint rig. Sleep (5.708s) visibly starts seated with hand support and reclines; not a standing-to-bed sequence.
- Added test/fixtures/meshy-motion-audition.html/.ts/.css: 14 numbered choices, original full tracks/root travel, default end hold, optional loop, pause/replay/scrub/speed, front/side/fit, skeleton and adjustable reference bed. The unnamed UUID file preserves both clips, including its 0.083s extra. No approved room/wardrobe animations replaced.
- Original assets and runtime manifest live in ignored output/meshy-motion-audition; no commercial raw GLBs in public or product imports. File/ZIP SHA256, exact names, durations and metadata recorded in art/chibi/motion-sources/meshy-user-pack-20260930.json and docs/chibi-motion-sources.md. No license file in the supplied pack; do not label it CC0/open source or assume public redistribution permission.
- Browser QA exercised all 14 + extra clip, end hold, scrub, speed, restart, loop, skeleton/reference bed and mobile. Caught candidate-reload race in test/UI readiness and mobile camera clipping, fixed both. Playwright skill loop passed without errors; inspected mid/end samples, sleep side view and corrected mobile screenshot. Standalone fixture build passes; git diff --check clean. UI open request queued for audition URL.
- Next: user picks candidates by number, then retarget selected motions onto current 48-bone character and adapt furniture contact/clothing. Source playback is verified; product retargeting and final acceptance are not done. No commit/push.

2026-09-30 — Eight selected Meshy motions integrated
- User mappings preserved exactly: 01 sleep, 04 seated alternate, 06 successful clothing-equip once, 07 coffee sip, 08/09 wave alternatives, 10 default body-2 walk, 13 yoga-mat crunch. Precise source names/hash/ZIP provenance retained in meshy-user-pack-20260930.json and MESHY-SELECTED-CREDITS.md. No uploads, commits or pushes.
- New deterministic Meshy importer derives rest world orientations from inverse bind matrices (export node transforms are posed), converts selected rotations plus normalized hip displacement to existing 48-bone rig. No replacement meshes or bone-length changes. Raw GLBs remain ignored local output.
- 10 becomes body-2 default, with older walks still selectable in comparison. 01 replaces final bed recline with full 5.708 s source and endpoint hold/reverse rise; existing walk-to-bed/edge phases preserved, minimal Three CCD IK prevents feet crossing mattress. 04 adds explicit floor-pouf alternate with the prior relaxed pose retained.
- 06 fires after a successful non-empty slot change, never initial load/removal/recolor/fit, completes once and resumes chosen wardrobe idle. Verified stable character UUID. 07 follows 8 s brewing with a full 8.875 s left-hand sip and prop cleanup. Fixed kitchen planning to use the actual navigation map, including the comparison spectator, instead of claiming departure after a mismatched route fails.
- 13 uses four cycles on a temporary green mat, grounded against actual posed skin. Searches reachable clear space without teleport; interruption/end removes mat. Existing furnished rooms can refuse when crowded; comparison now has a separate empty motion practice room with green/white/black palette. Mat is not a persistent furniture asset. No separate source down-to-mat/get-up animations yet; no universal cloth collision added.
- Validation: 44 targeted checks passed (7 files), plus new kitchen navigation-map regression checked separately. Browser verified actual source-retarget poses, 01 bed entry/end/rise, 04 alternate flag, 08/09 triggers, 13 approach/mat/end and crowded refusal, 06 equip-once/removal/UUID, 07 approach→work→sip→cleanup with assertions. Inspected .tmp/meshy-retarget-*.png, bed-contact-{recline,sleep,rise}.png, meshy-yoga-ui.png, meshy-equip-once.png, meshy-coffee-ui.png. Skill client .tmp/meshy-selected-skill passed and shot/state inspected. Comparison production build passes; final build rerun after routing fix.
- Whole-repo tsc was attempted but took too long without diagnostics and was stopped; no clean whole-repo typecheck claimed. Failed early browser attempts included live-reload/timeouts during concurrent edits, then rerun against stable code. Coffee's initial null task was a real navigation mismatch and was fixed; final QA asserts both work and sip rather than only checking cleanup.
- Next visual acceptance belongs to the user, especially outfit clearance under big arm motions and gym entry/exit. Vite remains running on 127.0.0.1:5173; no user character/house saves changed by test fixtures.

2026-09-30 — Single daily walk and authored mirror grooming
- User requested keeping only Meshy 10 Walking. Removed four older walking candidates, their UI selector, generated sample JSON and walk-only manifests; comparison and runtime use approvedRoomWalk.ts → meshyMotions.walk. Preserved shared wardrobe attribution and historical source credits.
- Researched official Three CCDIKSolver, Unity Two Bone IK and iClone pose-to-pose workflows; no exact reusable clothing-grooming asset was verified. User explicitly authorized making this gesture. New mirrorGrooming.ts authors an 8.8 s look-down → two-hand hem tidy → chest brush → mirror check → rest sequence. Existing Three CCD IK targets actual front garment vertices with clearance; virtual target bones never join the 48-bone skin. Reduced wrist rotation and lowered hem targets after visual review. No cloth simulation or universal clothing collision claim.
- Hooked only body-2 mirror-admire; Classic duration and Meshy 06 dress-once remain. Mirror activity finishes once and restores idle.
- Validation: 16 targeted tests pass across room walk, mirror, body room motion and new grooming regression (three heights, fixed feet/bone lengths, finite transforms, interruption recovery). Comparison Vite build passes. Browser mirror trigger/duration/finish assertions pass without page errors. Captured and inspected final garment poses .tmp/groom-stage-{1.9,4.6}.png; skill client verifies retained Meshy walking and state meshy-walk. First mirror camera view was obstructed by a wall; used empty motion room to inspect identical pose on actual clothed visitor. Initial fixture cleanup typo was caught and fixed by build; no remaining runtime import of removed walking files.
- This is a first authored gesture for user aesthetic review, not user-approved final animation. No commit/push or saved character/house mutation.

2026-09-30 — Study computer chair uniformly reduced
- User explicitly requested uniform scaling. gaming_chair catalog dimensions, all collision boxes and seat anchor scaled by 5/6 (width 1.50 → 1.25). Existing GLB loader normalizes against catalog width; source generator target synchronized. No per-axis edits or character scaling changes.
- Existing gaming, study layout and seating checks passed (24); docking's strict floating-point equality exposed a 1e-16 addition difference, changed position assertions to 10-decimal tolerance, all 7 docking checks pass. No new implementation-mirroring test.
- User clarified desk AND chair must shrink together. Desk plus its five tabletop devices now uniformly scale by 5/6; catalog contact/support/collision coordinates and generator widths/hardcoded desk clearances synchronized. Preset tabletop offsets scale with desk width; study lamp moves inward. Shared computerSeatOffset preserves a .28 body gap beyond table collision front; blind scaling had made the unchanged avatar torso overlap the desk, caught by existing tests and fixed. Existing precise microphone migration uses scaled destination. 25 gaming/docking/study checks pass after the complete set change (seating 6 already passed).

2026-09-30 — Body-2 computer interaction
- User froze furniture sizing and requested focusing on motion. Existing blankMotion had no computer/stream branch: body 2 only sat idle. Added computerMotion.ts with existing Three CCD IK, virtual wrist goals outside the 48-bone skin, gentle typing/mouse phase, finger curl and small screen-directed head movement. Actual mouse target comes from gaming activity; visitor passes explicit legacy-to-body coordinate scale.
- Seated hips and bone lengths remain fixed, existing slight seated ankle sway retained; no body rebuild or new third-party animation asset. Classic behavior unchanged. Stream currently shares the computer gesture.
- 22 focused tests passed, including three-height contact/mouse progression, finite transforms, fixed lengths and interruption restoration. Comparison production build passed. Actual UI selects computer, captures typing and mouse phase, and asserts completion without page errors; screenshots .tmp/computer-typing.png and computer-mouse.png inspected. Skill client also run for study scene. No furniture size changes in this step, no commit/push.

2026-09-30 — Lower computer chair seat
- User requested lower seat height. Kept the approved furniture width/depth; shortened gas-lift zone y=.20–.55 by .14, with wheels fixed and complete upper chair translated down. Seat .847625 → .707625; actual normalized GLB, catalog size/boxes/seats and generator share chair-seat-height.mjs. Preserved materials. Added cache revision and idempotent targeted asset repair; second execution confirmed no extra lowering.
- All 31 existing gaming/docking/study/seating checks passed. Browser rechecks typing/mouse/end on the lowered chair; no source animation changes, no commit/push.

2026-09-30 — Chair height fine adjustment
- User requested a little lower again: seat .707625 → .647625, another .06 drop, cumulative .20. Wheel hub unchanged; same upper dimensions. Height repair now inverts the prior deformation before applying the new one and uses a numeric drop marker; second run confirmed idempotent. Revision v2 invalidates old asset cache. 18 gaming/study checks pass; browser typing/mouse recheck and skill captures rerun. No furniture width/desk changes.

2026-09-30 — Complete existing study interactions
- User accepted final chair height, requested study motions complete. Added a distinct livestream greeting using approved Meshy 08 left upper-body tracks only (explicitly exclude thigh/shin/foot/toe), blended with keyboard contact; seated hips/legs remain unchanged. Attribution remains MESHY-SELECTED-CREDITS.
- Body-2 computer/stream now seek a genuinely reachable chair-side/diagonal landing on the current nav map, walk there, run seat transition, then start timed activity. Same-chair switching starts immediately; seat exit can find side clearance when desk blocks front. Refuse blocked approach instead of teleport. Expanded candidate radius to 2 room units after actual crowded study rejected closer landings.
- 31 focused checks passed across computer motion (now covers stream at three heights), gaming, seating, room motion and study. Final comparison build passes. Browser verifies actual approach/walk → seat → computer → rest → rise, separately stream approach → greeting → controls, no page errors. Inspected typing/mouse and stream screenshots; skill client run and inspected. Remaining bookshelf/printer props have no claimed action. No size changes, commits or pushes.
- Final study-specific browser pass also verified relaxed flower-pouf sitting, Meshy 04 alternate selection, standing back up, and monstera watering through completion. Inspected .tmp/study-pouf.png and study-water.png. Early pointer selection attempts were occluded at the default angle; rotating view and selecting visible furniture surface resolved QA without product changes.

2026-09-30 — Coffee mug grip
- User reported the mug was not held. The previous prop tracked only the left wrist translation, kept a fixed world orientation, and added an independent upward bob after pickup. Added coffeeGrip.js using the actual left index/middle finger joints and a calibrated hand-to-mug orientation; kitchen effects align the handle contact, blend pickup orientation, and remove the body-2 bob once held. Legacy body and other kitchen props retain their trajectories.
- 9 targeted tests passed: complete imported sip and brew at 3 sizes × 3 headings, exact handle/finger contact, unchanged bone lengths, resource lifecycle, and reset on next brew. Comparison fixture build passed (208 modules). Real browser approach → brew → sip → cleanup passed twice with no page errors; inspected near views .tmp/coffee-grip-{work,early,sip}.png and coffee-grip-front-*.png. Skill client ran .tmp/coffee-grip-skill.
- This corrects mug attachment, not the source Meshy arm retargeting or a general hand/object contact solver. No new motion asset or source credit changes.

2026-09-30 — Body 2 bathroom actions
- Kept four existing actions and clothes. Added bathroomJourney.js: reachable front candidates use actual navMap incl spectator, tub rim sit → turn/lift legs → lower (3.6 s), seated toilet entry, shower/laundry entry, timed work then reverse exit. stopWalking cancels to front; camera focus explicitly preserves the journey; invalidated/moved furniture clears it. Corrected bathtub body-2 orientation along the long axis so feet stay inside.
- Added bathroomMotion.ts reusing Three CCDIKSolver: palms near head for gentle shampoo, tub rim contact, washer button press then wait. Existing effects only run during work for body 2, washer shakes after 3.3 s and restores on exit. Legacy body unchanged; no new external motion assets, Meshy 10 approach credits unchanged.
- 15 bathroom/motion/layout tests passed; comparison build passed (210 modules). .tmp/bathroom-final-qa.mjs completed all four real interactions, camera continuity, exit and unchanged saved state with no page errors. .tmp/bathroom-cancel-qa.mjs passed interrupt during entry and work. Inspected final-bath-soak/shower/toilet; washer additional wall-hidden view inspected and its flow passed too. Skill client .tmp/bathroom-skill.
- Limits: reviewed furniture anchors and staged transitions, not swept cloth/furniture collision; no undressing or washer-door/loose-clothes model added. Keep current furniture sizes. No commit/push.

2026-10-01 — Body 2 remaining furniture actions
- User asked to find and implement the remaining body-2 furniture animations beyond the furnished showrooms. Audited activity kinds and found race, rhythm, eat and hug lacked body-2 branches. Added real two-arm CCD IK contacts, wheel-synchronized steering, height-adjusted rhythm squat/hops, spoon-to-face motion with the actual wrist driving the prop, and chest-relative plush holding. No skeleton stretching or new downloaded motion assets.
- Race and dining reuse the reachable chair approach/entry; activity revalidation now preserves stationId. Entering build mode clears device activities and meal effects. Existing classic behavior and saved furniture data retained.
- Registered selected Meshy sleep for the four older bed assets, including correctly rotated bunk slots. Single/double beds reuse staged entry; railed/high beds retain direct entry, no ladder motion. Checked actual GLB mattress points and visual sleep screenshots; moved loft head toward the foot to clear the raised pillow.
- Added ordinary seated foot-floor correction without changing the approved flower-pouf pose. Comparison fixture adds race/rhythm/dining/plush/beds/seats; bed/seat dropdown supports asset review without user saves.
- 47 tests across 8 focused files passed; comparison production build passed with existing large-chunk warning. Browser four-action lifecycle, left/right rhythm, both dining seats, natural finish, stop, actor change, edit cancellation, layout preservation, reduced motion and mobile width passed without page errors. Reviewed screenshots in .tmp/*-active.png, rhythm-beat-*.png, *-sleep.png, *-final.png. Skill client is .tmp/game-client.mjs (only runtime import/Edge and readiness timeout adapted), output .tmp/furniture-skill.
- Remaining distinct animation work: ladder climb, low-door duck, full pickup/arcade approach, yoga down/up clips, multi-resident occupancy and universal clothing collision. Static furniture has no newly invented interactions. Coverage and scope in docs/room3d-body2-actions.md. No commit/push. Preview service 127.0.0.1:5173.

2026-10-01 — User corrections: standing maimai and racing grip
- User rejected squat/hops: removed body-2 hip/leg travel, added independent half-beat-staggered palm tapping at 0.30 s per hand, shared button lights, actual reach selection and stable stand position. Legacy jumping retained.
- Measured actual racing GLB rim: previous authored targets were inside/in front of the wheel. Added palm/grip offsets and a shared tilted wheel pivot. User then spotted reversed hands in the screenshot; corrected outward finger wrap with thumbs up and added an explicit thumb-above-pinky assertion.
- Regression checks cover palm contacts and stable feet at three heights, fast different-height notes, actual GLB rim contact in four headings, bone lengths, release, and wheel transform reset. No new motion assets, no version bump, no commit/push.
- Final verification: 49 focused tests and comparison production build passed. Actual browser covered corrected racing grip from both sides, left/right standing rhythm, natural finish, stop, actor switch, edit cancellation, unchanged saves, mobile width and static hips/hands under reduced motion; no page errors. Skill client output .tmp/gaming-correction-skill; corrected grip views .tmp/race-grip-front.png and .tmp/race-grip-side.png.

2026-10-02 — Selected home motion implementation
- Frozen second user export: 39 dynamic clips (18 pairs/21 solo), 14 static photo poses retained separately. Generated lazy selected motion bundles with common paired capture coordinates, source hashes and full notices. Removed 482 unselected intake files (~97.6 MB), pruned source picker and made restore scripts selection-only.
- Added selectedSocial runtime, both-body source playback, contact and floor/head guards, seven agreed categories, cancellation/failed-load/trajectory guards, transient phone/can props. Production Home3DView now has an invite/participant/action panel; uniform body selection, user/character roster and independent visitor heights; editor owns lifecycle and cancels on edit/room/furniture transitions. No layout schema migration.
- Existing selected furniture actions preserved. Static photo retargeting, autonomous social AI and general garment collision are outside this implementation.
- Validation: 13 focused tests pass; isolated production builds of the social, Home3DView and source-library fixtures pass (existing chunk-size warning). All 39 source IDs load on both bodies; all 39 sampled at 80%/125% heights in both role orders without nonfinite transforms or bone-length changes. Production tests cover both body types, invitations, solo ownership, stop/edit cancellation, unchanged layout save and mobile overflow. All 53 retained source previews still load; visual sheets and contact/height/mobile screenshots inspected. Whole-repo tsc still reports existing JS declaration/config errors; no clean full-project typecheck claimed.

2026-10-02 — Character illustration / flat home view
- Apply a one-pass two-tone shader to both visitor bodies, hair and wardrobe; keep the face shading gentler, retain alpha/UV/skinning. No outline geometry added.
- Add default flat orthographic composition and an explicit flat/free toggle independent of quality. Disable rotate/pan/wheel/pinch and automatic character/rhythm closeups in flat mode; retain button zoom/reset and point interactions.
- Extend the isolated home fixture with ?room=bedroom&body=blank for a furnished composition without loading or overwriting real home saves. Browser and image validation in progress.
- Visual QA: inspected original/illustrated closeups for both bodies; face and fabric highlights are now controlled, painted hair/eyes preserved. Inspected desktop and portrait furnished room screenshots.
- Regression: 30 tests passed (flat camera bounds/material preservation, topology, social, furniture motions). Production browser checks pass for flat/free gestures, zoom/reset, closeup lock, editing lock, point walking, furniture picking on both bodies, room switching/overview, reload preference, both-body social playback and cancellation; no console/page errors after guarding pre-load ResizeObserver.
- A crossing fixture confirms classic residents switch rooms without moving the flat camera; normal physical clearance remains enforced (the tall body cannot pass that fixture's low door). No collision bypass added.
- First flat-view iteration remains real-time 3D. Foreground furniture fading, a dedicated phone composition and further scene-wide paint treatment remain possible art iterations, not part of this implementation. No general photo/2D sprite baking was added.

2026-10-02 — Rename locked view / easier walking
- User clarifies this is not true 2D: UI now says 视角锁定 / 自由视角. Retained the existing internal flat preference for compatibility. Enable mouse-wheel and two-finger zoom while keeping rotation and pan locked; +/- and reset remain available.
- Walking alone uses an 85% round head clearance rather than a full square and requires feet/torso rather than hair to remain over the floor. Body collision, solid walls and full clearance for social standing checks remain intact.
- Direct ground clicks can land within 0.6 units of an obstructed target using a reachable nearby point. Furniture/door targets remain exact; no snapping a blocked start or a valid destination across a wall.
- 27 targeted tests pass; real-browser zoom and movement checks in progress.
- Browser validation completed: wheel in/out, phone pinch zoom, +/-/reset, fixed camera orientation, ordinary walking, editing and return to free view all pass with no page/console errors. Inspected desktop and zoomed mobile screenshots; 3-fixture production build passes (existing chunk-size warning).

2026-10-02 — Bedside entry transition
- User reports sitting first, sliding onto the bed and then rotating to the source starting pose. Aligned entry Z with the selected sleep clip's initial pelvis (scaled to the actual rig), separated standing turn/backstep from sitting, and transferred pelvis support while knees bend.
- Added source-first-pose blending before playback and compensated its local root in the parent transition to avoid the second translation at the seam. Reused approved walk for backward approach / forward departure; preserved bone lengths and the selected sleep clip.
- Restrict entry to the selected bed side and nearby longitudinal points; no fallback to the opposite edge followed by a slide across the mattress. Existing high-bed immediate placement retained.
- Inspected bedroom frames at approach, seated, turn-in and recline; browser entry/exit completes without errors. 16 focused bedroom/seating tests pass; final build and client replay below.
- Final validation: 16 bedroom/seating tests pass, including source-root handoff continuity and rejection of opposite-side fallback. Furnished bedroom full entry / source playback / stand-up replay passes with no browser errors; latest frame screenshots and game-client capture inspected. Preview production build passes (existing chunk-size warning).

2026-10-02 — Room daylight art pass and phone render budget
- User asks for Shinkai-inspired room lighting and mobile performance. Retained planar character treatment and locked-view zoom. Added cool sky/blue-violet ambient, warm sunlight, restrained furniture reflection (roughness .82 / max 3.5%), and a daylight range above cel bands so window illumination remains visible. Existing window panes now render a procedural blue/peach sky and soft clouds with no extra geometry/textures/postprocessing.
- Eco now retains one 512² cached, occluded window projection; touch/phone stays at one source in every quality. Desktop Clear permits two. Overview disables projections. PCF replaces VSM blur passes. With windows, frontal fill no longer casts a contradictory second shadow; windowless desktop balanced/clear retains cached key shadow. Actor-only motion doesn't invalidate per-light shadows; furniture edits, doors/fridge, and held-plush removal/return do. Held plush follows avatar no-cast treatment.
- Eco/touch/phone/overview skip the full-scene furniture outline mask/composite; desktop balanced/clear honors saved preference. Quality UI explains suspension without overwriting preference. Outline object list cached on rebuild; skip empty social-resident pathfinding. Phone Clear is capped at 30 fps even with coarse-pointer detection absent.
- Browser measured same furnished bedroom before/after at .75 pixel ratio: 345 -> 174 stable-frame draw calls; submitted triangles 220037 -> 110018. Added one cached window shadow, so first render/geometry updates cost more than these steady-frame values. This is Edge SwiftShader + mobile emulation, NOT physical phone fps proof.
- Validation: 20 unit tests (lighting budgets, daylight geometry, furniture interactions, fixed view, walking clearance) passed. Selected 252-module Vite fixture build passed, existing >500KB chunk warnings remain. Final lighting matrix: bedroom all three qualities desktop/390px touch, classic living, blank study/kitchen, windowless classic phone; no page/console errors, eco idle sleeps, no mobile overflow. Screenshots reviewed. Existing window QA adapted locally for runtime/port/free-view and new eco expectation: source movement/height/store/undo/redo/wall views/quality cycling/reload/resource reuse passed. Locked-camera mouse/pinch/zoom/walk/free-view QA and required skill client passed.
- Artifacts: .tmp/lighting-baseline.json, .tmp/lighting-qa.json, .tmp/light-*.png, .tmp/flat-first; window occlusion screenshots/report in ignored output/window-daylight. No asset downloads, version bump, commit or push. Real low-end phone GPU/frame-time testing remains hardware-dependent.
- Additional final browser check: actual room door opens during walking and triggers a shadow refresh; fridge opening regenerates shadows only while moving, then returns to stable draw cost. Both passed with no console/page errors; .tmp/lighting-transitions.mjs and .tmp/light-fridge-open.png. Final selected-fixture build passed after all lighting changes.

2026-10-02 — Brighter interiors with morning/day/sunset/night
- User rejects dull interiors, requests time-dependent light. Raised cel-shadow floor .48 -> .74 and neutral interior/sky fill, preserved bright material colours. Added four art-directed profiles (05–08 morning / 08–16 day / 16–19 sunset / 19–05 night), plus default automatic mode and per-device manual selection in renamed 光影 panel. Night uses readable warm interior + weak cool window light and procedural stars/moon, not an overall black exposure.
- New roomLighting.js shares GPU uniform objects across furniture/sky shaders. Profiles change existing lights, sky/background, and mild illustration character tint without rebuilding geometry or compiling new programs. Fixed sky moon aspect ratio. Two character types and extra residents receive the same room tint; standalone social previews remain neutral.
- Owner timezone resolved in Home3DView via existing timezone.ts helpers, changes propagate live. Automatic mode polls once per minute only while visible/unsuspended, redraws only at a new band, resyncs immediately on visibility/resume, clears timer on dispose; manual mode stops polling. Times are art bands, not geographic sun simulation.
- 26 focused tests passed. Browser .tmp/time-light-qa.mjs verifies desktop/phone four-way UI cycling, persistence, restore auto, suspension, no overflow, unchanged layout/position; steady 174 draw calls and same [1035 geometries,12 textures,25 programs,151 materials] across all profiles. .tmp/time-light-clock-qa.mjs uses Playwright clock to verify real automatic boundary wake, no same-band redraw, owner timezone switch, fixed manual mode, resume and dispose cleanup; no errors. Required game client .tmp/run-time-light-client.mjs produces clean .tmp/time-light-skill output; inspected all desktop phases and phone panel. Selected 254-module fixture build passed (existing large-chunk warnings). First intermediate client saw missing setTimeZone while editor patch had not applied; resolved before final clean browser runs.
- Final screenshots .tmp/time-light-{morning,day,sunset,night}-{desktop,phone}.png; report .tmp/time-light-qa.json. No new render passes, version bump, asset download, commit or push. Real phone frame-time verification remains hardware-dependent.
- Final spot-check: night moon aspect visually reviewed; original/retro style and eco/balanced rebuilds preserve selected night profile, no page/console errors (.tmp/time-light-final.mjs).


2026-10-02 — Morning / golden-hour sunlight and character lighting correction
- Studied the free COZY GOLDEN HOUR ROOM 3D Blender/Cycles listing/preview (https://www.fab.com/listings/7e66a803-9dd3-47d0-b8a5-b303ea65ed56), official ReShade and Blender light docs. No .blend download/import, paid asset or reference-image texture. Implemented procedural real-time equivalents rather than claiming offline-render fidelity.
- Normalized pane bounds now infer real wall apertures, including offset; curtains/frames/props still cast while panes do not. Morning/sunset reuse directional key as window-aligned sun, disable pooled spots; phone/eco sun shadows 512² and cached. Day/night retain pooled spot window projection. Effective sun contrast off without exterior window/overview.
- Added procedural layered clouds/sunset rims/distant silhouette and optional roomFinishPass: one framebuffer copy plus a nine-tap fullscreen draw, correct sRGB decode/output, no second geometry pass. Initial SRGB framebuffer-copy prototype was black; fixed to raw framebuffer texture with explicit decoding before final validation. Per-device toggle and resize/dispose cleanup included.
- User caught characters missing from lighting: old illustration shader discarded real light and disabled shadow receiving. Now both body types and all home residents bind shared room uniforms, receive static room occlusion, use actual diffuse light energy/direction while retaining painted features, clothes, face brightness floor and no specular. Independent previews retain fixed illustration light. Character casting remains disabled to preserve cached phone shadows.
- 31 unit tests pass. WebGL pixel test (.tmp/character-light-gpu.mjs) moves an occluder and confirms the real character shader swaps lit [117,46,37] / shaded [47,23,35] pixels. Tests also preserve material maps/alpha and shared uniforms without per-phase material rebuild.
- .tmp/sun-final-qa.mjs: desktop both bodies + phone blank, repeated four-phase UI cycles, finish +/- one draw, preference reload, unchanged layout/position, resize/disposed old texture and no overflow/errors. Blank steady 175 draws, classic 181; warm blank [1037 geometries,15 textures,40 programs,151 cached furniture materials], stable after repeated cycles. Initial assertion mistakenly applied blank <180 count to classic; corrected budget and reran successfully. First phase/lighting-type switches allocate shader/map variants; this supersedes the prior no-compilation-for-all-phases statement.
- .tmp/window-daylight-qa.mjs passed window height/move/store/history/quality/resource checks; .tmp/lighting-transitions.mjs passed door/fridge invalidation and return to cached shadows. .tmp/time-light-clock-qa.mjs passed auto boundary/owner timezone/manual/idle/pause/dispose. Required skill client rerun clean; inspected its screenshot, both morning/sunset rooms, phone, night and clear close-up. Selected fixture build passes (256 modules), existing large chunk warnings only.
- Final images .tmp/sun-final-*, .tmp/sun-character-close.png; resources/report .tmp/sun-final-qa.json. Hardware phone FPS remains unmeasured. No version bump, commit or push. Native ReShade and physically traced GI are not installed or claimed.

2026-10-02 — RoomApp 3D visit entry / pixel home moves to Memory Palace
- RoomApp third tab is now 拜访（测试版）3D. Character card opens Home3DView directly, binding the selected owner's home3D, saved chibi appearance, user/other resident options and the existing updateCharacter save path. Back returns to the same visit list; no 2D initialization or generation request. Removed the former in-room temporary 3D button; renderer/error return labels are now neutral 返回. Existing 小小窝 / 世界家园 retained.
- PixelHomeView is lazy-loaded by MemoryPalaceApp as a second character page beside 记忆房间. Map has the shared page switch and a labeled back button; child editor/dive returns retain existing behavior. Enabled even if memory extraction is off, using the same charId and unchanged pixel layouts/assets/theme/character records. No save migration, cloning or deletion.
- Updated typed roomLaunch tab to home3D (no remaining pixelHome caller), docs and existing analytics enum documentation; no new telemetry. Extended real-OSProvider fixture home3d.html with ?app=memory.
- Browser .tmp/room-entry-qa.mjs uses isolated test IndexedDB: 390px UI direct visit, actual palette change persisted via OSContext/DB, owner A/B isolation, reload restore, social visitor inclusion, renderer unmount/back, memory page/pixel page/back, old pixel layout deep equality, disabled-palace pixel access, no horizontal overflow and no unexpected LLM requests. No page errors. Existing Sully remote avatar CDN denied by sandbox network (recorded separately in report), not an entry/runtime error.
- Fixed an initial placement of the new page switch into a memory-link search block before successful QA; actual screenshots now show the switch next to the seven-room overview and above pixel map. Interim QA selector mismatches (palette panel, label, roomId key) corrected and complete flow rerun successfully.
- Inspected .tmp/room-entry-list.png, .tmp/room-entry-home.png, .tmp/memory-entry-detail.png, .tmp/memory-entry-pixel.png; required game client .tmp/room-entry-skill replayed actual RoomApp visit tab. Integration fixture production build: 5100 modules, successful with existing mixed-import/large chunk warnings and fixture classic-script warning. git diff --check passes. No version bump or commit/push for this entry reorganization.

2026-10-02 — Connect existing facial states and natural blinking to home residents
- Existing FbxBody already had original/sleep/happy face atlases and opt-in split-face blinking. Home visitors without explicit hair.face had no blink, and eco idle scheduling never woke for it. Kept original identities/materials and bound the existing atlases to an independent resident expression clock.
- New residentExpression.ts supplies stable per-instance offsets (3.6–5.3s, 160ms closed). Visitor exposes expression updates; FbxBody reports authored/motion eye state, preserving sleep/cute states. Shared render entry applies face after captured/social pose solving so animate(0) cannot freeze the expression clock. No new textures/canvas uploads or shadow invalidations.
- HomeSocialPanel adds per-active-resident 自然·跟随动作 / 开心闭眼 / 闭眼 and 自然眨眼, held only for the visit. Editor remembers settings across body replacement, applies to primary/social/comparison residents and wakes only at eye state edges; hides/pauses/dispose clear the timer, reduced motion/edit/overview disable automatic blinking.
- 13 focused tests pass (blink timing/separation/fixed states, material preservation, social motion). .tmp/face-qa.mjs verifies both bodies naturally blink in eco with only 2 additional frames, open/closed/happy visuals, guest control independent of owner, stable geometry/program/texture counts on repeated choices, pause/dispose. .tmp/face-lifecycle-qa.mjs passes mobile body switch, reduced motion, explicit happy override, suspend/resume and no overflow. No console/page errors.
- Inspected all face states plus mobile controls and the required game-client screenshot; selected-fixture build passes (existing chunk warnings). Runtime quality/light-clock QA that previously expected absolutely no idle draws must disable blinking for that assertion; automatic natural blinking intentionally wakes twice per cycle. Artifacts .tmp/face-*.png / face-qa.json / face-build.log. No version bump, commit or push.

2026-10-02 — Floor tap feedback and rug navigation
- Root cause: walkingMap already excludes rugs, but visit-mode item picking consumed rug taps as furniture interactions with no actions. Visit-mode rugs now route their actual raycast surface point to walkTo; edit picking and overlaid furniture actions/collisions remain intact. An open furniture menu closes and the same floor tap starts walking.
- Added reusable walkFeedback.js floor marker: green/white ring on the resolved navigation endpoint; red ring + X for rejected taps. Stays while walking, fades 0.65s after arrival; blocked state expires after 1s. Geometry raised above actual rug surface, min 28 CSS px width at room zoom. No textures/shadows/new render pass; cancellation/disposal clears, reduced motion disables pulse/fade, eco returns to idle after feedback. Existing ground targetRadius remains .6.
- Browser .tmp/walk-feedback-qa.mjs passes blank and classic: rug click -> visible marker -> actual arrival at endpoint -> expiry; rug selection in edit; bed action above rug; tap out of action menu -> walk; retarget; blocked X; no idle frames after expiry and no console/page errors. Inspected rug/floor/blocked screenshots. .tmp/walk-mobile-qa.mjs passes 390x844 touch + reduced motion, cancellation/edit, arrival, drag and native touchCancel, disposal and no overflow. Initial synthetic pointer test generated OrbitControls capture errors because the injected pointer was not active; replaced with real CDP touchStart/touchCancel and reran clean.
- 8 walking/flat-view tests pass, including rug walkability while solid furniture still blocks. Required .tmp/run-walk-client.mjs uses real floor click; inspected .tmp/walk-skill/shot-0.png and state shows matching walking target. Selected fixture production build passes with existing chunk warnings; git diff --check passes. No version bump, commit or push.

2026-10-02 — Cozy night lamp glow
- User requested a little glow for warmer nighttime lighting. Added lampGlow.js: detects actual warm-emissive lamp parts, derives their centers/diameters from geometry, follows their world transforms, and batches up to 16 depth-tested analytic halos into one Points draw. No textures, realtime lights, shadow maps or continuous animation. Outline mask omits Points. Night + existing 柔光调色 only; overview/off hides, rebuild refreshes, dispose releases. Night finish glow .07 -> .12 with mild .45 highlight warmth; all other phase settings unchanged.
- .tmp/lamp-qa.mjs passes desktop and 390px touch: 4 actual bedroom emitters (initial test assumed 3; dresser also has a warm emitter), night-only visibility, finish toggle costs exactly 2 draws including pre-existing finish pass (halo adds just 1), repeated phase/resource stability, untouched layouts, eco idle no extra frames, overview, resize/no overflow and disposal. No console/page errors. Inspected desktop on/off, phone and required skill-client screenshots.
- .tmp/lamp-placement-qa.mjs verifies floor-lamp move, store and undo, with halos following/removing/restoring correctly. Initial assertion assumed source index stays stable after moveInHome; corrected lookup by lamp height since furniture ordering changes on moves. No application error.
- 19 existing lighting/timezone/character rendering tests passed; selected fixture build passes (existing chunk warnings). Required .tmp/run-time-light-client.mjs rerun and screenshot inspected. Artifacts .tmp/lamp-*.png, lamp-qa.json, lamp-build.log. Real phone GPU timing remains unmeasured. No version bump, commit or push.


## 2026-10-03 家园共同生活闭环

2026-10-03 — Animal Island UI requested by user: installed 2.1.0 and classnames, integrated real menu cards/title/switch and radial footer buttons, scoped cream paper/brown text/teal selection theme to Home3DView. Visually verified menu and head-anchored interactions in current home3d fixture. Fixed old span rule washing out library text. Related 20 tests and Vite production build validated. Screenshots: output/home-life/island-menu.jpg, island-wheel.jpg.

2026-10-03 — Default floor/furniture control now uses user avatar; explicit character/user control in resident menu. Added seated-only startle with fixed seat and upper-body blending, pagination by the radial choices, collapsible home map. Browser verified pink user sitting on sofa, seated startle while black-haired character stays put; menu/layout regression tests cover hidden standing reaction and nearby pagination.

2026-10-03 — Paired motions now approach using actual room paths, distance-based duration, synchronized start, and walking animation. Completion/cancellation no longer restores the starting transforms or triggers idle respawn. Added approach, unreachable path, detour, and retained-position regressions (14 related tests passed). Mobile home preview exercised paired low-five in the empty room.

2026-10-03 — Fixed shared user orientation reversal after quaternion copies (XYZ Euler pitch/roll remnants); all editor yaw assignments now reset full orientation with YXZ. Paired social release ends facing partner. 19 related tests passed.

## 2026-10-03 home experience review
Implemented entrance camera approach + happy wave, compact wall-mode control/map, star for independent owner room, self summon, double-tap focus/lock with panning, single hierarchical back, chronological explicit actor/target records, expanded reachable interaction-area search, procedural paired hug, removal of expansion/build/test restore entries, editable room names using existing ID-based schedule prompt, and furniture search/drawer/top bar cleanup.
Validation: 41 targeted tests pass. Browser QA observed greeting, double-tap lock (rotate=false, pan=true), room switch with owner absent, summon with star and presence record, hug approach/hold/release, and mobile furniture search. Build succeeded. Full repository tsc reports extensive errors outside this change (including references to beauty-library worktree); found and corrected optional controlResident invocation in touched wheel. Dedicated test/fixtures/home-review.html uses in-memory sample residents; production preview remains home3d.html. Hug contact for arbitrary custom hair/clothing and extreme heights is not exhaustively verified.

## Wave correction and compact camera controls
Entrance now samples the approved 招手 clip (vrma-8bd33d84e90c0243), rather than wave-cute. Old 可爱挥手/冷静挥手 removed from the ordinary editor motion list; retained only as implementations for explicit comparison. Added /test/fixtures/home-waves.html with 招手, 挥手回应, two old procedural waves, and numbered 08/09 for user identification; replay and half-second freeze controls. Main HUD hides the entire right camera/decorate stack; a lightweight 视角 control next to room name opens combined camera/wall choices. Browser verified approved animation posing and camera menu; production build passed. Main preview and wave comparison left available to user.

## Portrait interior framing trial
Formal portrait home now uses a 5.8-unit vertical orthographic frame and a low front angle, framing the visible resident above the dock instead of fitting the whole room width. Overview/decoration retain full-house framing. Added 室内近景 / 看全屋 choices inside the existing camera popover, preserving wide framing across resizes. Browser verified loaded living room, full-room comparison, near reset, map collapse; no console errors. Production build passed (68s). Screenshot: output/home-life/portrait-living.jpg. This trial centers one resident; automatic paired-action camera framing is not added in this change.

## Interior visual extension trial
Added a noninteractive scene-only floor and back/left wall extension (window/door wall rectangle left untouched); interior mode hides low shell base meshes and caps zoom-out at .85. Extensions are outside content/nav/room fitting and dispose their own geometry/materials. Overview, explicit wide view, dollhouse wall mode and decoration restore normal model edges and zoom range. Verified mobile zoom-out limit, full toy-house overview, return to interior, no browser errors; production build passed (25.27s). Screenshot output/home-life/interior-extended.jpg. Extended floor currently uses room base color rather than repeating the authored floor pattern.

## Automatic walls and compact navigation
Cutaway now constructs all four walls and hides camera-facing edges with an 0.08 angular hysteresis band; follows wall-mounted decorations, doors and visual extension panels. Pure automaticWalls helper plus topology regressions: 20 tests passed. Edit rebuilds static wall visibility; overview/dollhouse retain fixed presentation. HUD is now one compact cream navigation strip, no title card or persistent floor/saved subtitle; compact map and no-wrap camera menu. Browser loaded successfully with no error logs and screenshot output/home-life/automatic-walls-header.jpg. User appears to be actively trying modes/interactions; avoided resetting their final view. Visibility currently switches with hysteresis, not opacity fading.

## Continuous interior floor
Replaced flat-color backdrop with extendedFloor from the existing finishes material factory. Interior floor now uses one continuous plane with physical UV coordinates, same floor style/color/shader, hiding the shell and original finish floor to avoid seams and z-fighting. Overview/edit restore original floors. Backdrop borrows cached finish material without disposing it. Legacy original floor uses procedural wood in interior mode. Browser verified wood planks continue beneath dock after zooming out, no errors; build passed (29.24s). Screenshot output/home-life/continuous-floor.jpg.

## Near eye-level camera
Lowered the portrait interior/greeting pitch from about 16 degrees to 4.3 degrees; adjusted target height to 1.45 to retain feet above dock. Orthographic camera offset now (0,4.5,60), preserving the framing while keeping foreground floor in front of the near clip plane at this shallow angle. Browser verified full body, continuous floor to bottom, no console errors.

## Requested camera defaults
Formal home initializes free + automatic walls + whole-room; added 恢复默认 inside camera menu. Automatic front edge is always hidden, including mounted objects/extensions; other edges retain angle hysteresis. Double-tap focus and default focusResident no longer switch to locked mode. Greeting restores whole-room framing after completion unless canvas input interrupts it. 21 wall/topology tests passed; build passed 27.88s. Preview service had stopped; restarted Vite on 127.0.0.1:5183 (session 24886), HTTP 200 verified. Browser's old error-page data URL prevented further automation; open_in_codex queued the healthy preview. Final new browser interactions not verified this turn.

## Camera changes preserve resident actions
Formal camera mode/default/wall switches no longer rebuild content or call placeVisitor; wall visibility now updates for all wall modes. Backdrop builds all wall extensions once so hidden/auto switches need no reconstruction. Removed stopWalking from focusResident and greeting cancellation from pointerdown; camera commands only cancel camera arrival/automatic return, not the greeting action. Browser home-review verified home-hug at t=3.5 retained exact positions and session across lock, hidden walls, restore-default; subsequent advance completed the action. Production build passed. Overview still follows its existing separate rebuild path; this change targets the camera/wall popup and focus/gestures.

## Resident portrait camera rail
Added right-side room resident portraits with Animal Island theme tokens, selected accent ring and transient name. Main/user/guest profile avatars flow through Home3DView + HomeResidentOption; unavailable images fall back to initials or provided emoji. Rail maps current rendered actor IDs correctly when user/owner bodies swap for furniture, and hides during edit/overview. Click centers visible resident bounds with a camera tween, retaining zoom/orientation and all actions/control selection. Camera arrival now keeps render loop awake even without resident animations. Old tab 12 is an error-page data URL; browser policy explicitly blocks accessing it, so no bypass attempted and visual QA remains unverified this turn. First production build passed; final build log output/home-life/resident-rail-build-final.txt.

## Radial interaction back navigation
Added an always-visible back button beside near-ring pagination, using the existing Animal Island paper pill. Back returns to previous page, then category list, then closes the wheel at root; Escape follows the same path. Removed the distant duplicate category-back footer control. Navigation only changes menu state and never calls action stop. All 9 homeSocialWheel tests passed; production build passed in 47.18s (existing chunk/eval warnings). Browser visual verification not performed this turn.

## Personal wardrobe and animal accessories (2026-10-03)
Implemented MyWardrobe under existing 3D wardrobe: save/wear/rename/delete and versioned JSON export/import (clothing only; colors, fits, layering included). UserProfile wardrobeOutfits uses transactional updates and survives stale profile saves; full backup includes library. Legacy initial hoodie retained when adding accessories. Added six original skinned cat/dog/fox ears/tails, independent slots, regional colors and fit controls, reference manifest/reproducible generator/current skeleton; added head-size adaptation and preview headroom. All six actual GLB thumbnails rendered and inspected; corrected dog inner-ear overlap, floating ear roots and unindexed extruded ears. 32 relevant tests passed (22 fit/catalog/color + 10 library/UI); six-asset wardrobe:check passed 4 poses each, no data failures. Final production build passed 23.29s. Browser verified fox ears+tail wearing and QA in-memory outfit save; screenshot output/home-life/my-wardrobe-preview.png. Browser download event capture timed out; share serialization roundtrip verified in tests, not end-to-end download/file chooser. Test fixture hot dispose fixed after QA console warning. Returned preview to normal storage route, QA library never wrote user records. Tail follows hips without secondary physics; large hair/clothing can need manual fitting.

## Animal accessories visual redo (2026-10-03)
Replaced rejected flat oversized ear geometry with closed curved pinnae, recessed inner ears, rear shells and smaller hair-embedded roots. Rebuilt cat/dog/fox tail profiles and fox fur clumps with continuous material-seam normals. Stable asset IDs, current skeleton, independent colors and fitting retained. Regenerated six actual GLB thumbnails; browser checked worn fox front/back and ear silhouettes. Six accessory combinations x four poses passed with zero data failures (5 tests); production build passed. Preview screenshot: output/home-life/accessories-redo-preview.png. Visual direction remains pending user acceptance; no secondary tail physics added.

## Ear roots blended into scalp
User clarified exposed bottom corners must merge into head. Added smooth root taper, inward fold and rearward recession to cat/fox ears and dog attachment; no change to tails. Regenerated three ear thumbnails. Checked fox front/oblique wearing, asset acceptance passed. Screenshot output/home-life/ear-roots-preview.png.

## Ear-root revision reverted at user request
Reverted only the last scalp taper/inward-fold modification. Regenerated original redo geometry and three ear thumbnails; restored 695424-byte asset. Previous ear-root entry is superseded. Other accessory and wardrobe work retained.

## Fox ear contour from user paint-over
Preserved fox ear tips and inner conchae; extended only outer lower fur down along side hair to remove horizontal flared corners. Both ears mirrored. Cat/dog/tails unchanged. Regenerated GLB/catalog revision and fox thumbnail. Fox accessory acceptance passed; front and oblique browser inspection. Screenshot output/home-life/fox-ear-contour.png.

## Fox ears inward placement
Removed the rejected downward fur extension entirely. Restored original ear geometry and moved fox centers from +/-0.57 to +/-0.43 only. Regenerated asset and fox thumbnail; front wearing preview inspected. Supersedes previous contour paint-over implementation. Screenshot output/home-life/fox-ears-inset.png.

## Longer fox ears and dyeable rabbit accessories
Fox ears height .59 -> .77 and center .43 -> .36. Added rabbit ears and rounded tail with independent ear fur/inner color regions and single tail fur region. Eight accessory thumbnails regenerated at 512px with neutral soft lighting and margins. Rabbit body preview framing expanded to avoid clipped tips. Browser verified actual rabbit tail/inner-ear dye, restored default colors; all 8 accessory combinations x 4 poses passed and production build passed. No changes saved to user avatar.

2026-10-03 — Home pet autonomy implementation
- Unified six-species whole-mesh pet runtime, local needs/utility/traits/relationships, independent persistence, adoption/conversion, bowls, colors and panel. Tests 12 passed. Browser/production verification in progress.
- Added pure-color toy/mat assets, persistent pet schema, dynamic occupancy checks, station reservations/invalidation, relationship cooldown and rest-mat preference. Production Home3DView preview: /test/fixtures/home-pets.html. 32 related tests passed before four additional behavioral tests; latest 16 pet/asset tests passed. Vite production build passed with existing circular chunk/PDF eval notices. Browser screenshots reviewed desktop and mobile; fixed palette expansion and keyboard focus. Final production UI checks ongoing.
- Final verification: 36 related tests passed; browser QA passed including positive UI adoption, real pet mesh picking, calling a pet to the user, and room-switch persistence in production Home3DView. Reviewed full production and 390px mobile screenshots. No outstanding blocker. First version intentionally stays within assigned room; no offline progression, no LLM pet calls. Preview uses isolated data; production entry is My Home → Pets or the pet button.
- Final visual fix: pets now invalidate the static shadow cache only when their rendered pose changes, removing stale floor shadows; production help hint hides while pet panel is open. Re-ran full browser QA and 16 pet/asset tests successfully; desktop/mobile screenshots inspected. Preview open requested in Codex sidebar.

## User-authored built-in outfits
Imported six supplied sully-outfit JSON documents into builtinOutfits.json, preserving all clothing fits, color regions and layering flags. Added six built-in presets and removed old cardigan/school preset entries. New presets apply full outfit state via existing applyOutfit and compare full parameters for selected state. Personal closet and individual garments retained. Nine wardrobe/library tests passed, including exact fit/color preservation from six supplied documents; production build passed. Browser verified six entries and wearing maid outfit 2.

2026-10-03 — Add supplied Blue Cuddle Shark and round turtle head
- Source shark: 4265 triangles, 3 images; geometry-only source 7.glb. Shark 3753 triangles with five editable pure-color roles and eight palettes. Turtle revised round head and eye/mouth positions; 3829 triangles. Common rest squash reduced to 3%. Asset revisions preserve existing pet IDs/colors while refreshing geometry. Capacity/preview/persistence updated together to seven. Browser validation in progress.
- Completed shark/turtle update: 16 unit tests passed; all 56 palettes and live seven-pet UI/browser QA passed, including save/reload and capacity. Source/front/side/back/bottom, full gallery and shared-room screenshots visually checked. Shark moved to a clear preview spawn away from the user. Updated asset ZIP with seven GLBs; opened revised home preview.

2026-10-03 — Independent game-like pet panel
- Replaced plain pet settings list with Island-styled portrait roster and care/look/journal detail tabs. Actual model/color portraits, bond tiers, needs, five care buttons, runtime progress, real completion gains, supplies and living journal. Kept shared whole-body motion, strengthened play hops, no LLM calls or invented currency.
- Completion payload now belongs to the exact runtime action, so cancellation cannot be misreported as a later successful interaction. Pausing freezes progress and preview motion; reduced-motion preference respected.
- 22 unit tests passed (pets, pet life, home panel). Existing full browser QA passed; new panel QA passed portraits, refill, play/journal, cancellation, pause/rest and 390px layout. Skill client ran on production Home3DView; state output and desktop/mobile screenshots reviewed. Preview ready.

## Embodied home conversation and live context
Added current furniture names and character action targets, model social execution with model attribution, randomized selected talking clips while waiting/speaking without replacing occupied actions. Lifecycle stop on failure/unmount/manual revision; no gestures on regeneration. Chat lists action records. Moved home experiences to volatile chat state while call/date core retain them; home generation includes passed records even without saved home3D. Browser local simulator verified actual sit action + speech records present in chatLive and callDateCore. Real provider not called; user's reported formal-entry omission not reproduced/root-caused. Relevant tests and production build checked in output/home-life/conversation-* logs.

2026-10-03 — Physical petting and chest carry
- User request: actual crouching to pet, and carrying pets against the chest while walking.
- Added coordinated approach/stroke/lift/hold/lower controller, 48-bone crouch with grounded feet and hand IK, surface-derived head contact, sideways chest cradle, locomotion with held arms, safe floor placement and compact scene controls. Same pet model is reused. Current-room carrying; interruption restores floor state and preserves new actor actions. No offline held state or artificial affection reward for holding.
- 33 related tests passed; final cleanup rechecked 16 contact/life tests. Contact browser QA passed actual mesh/hand targets, crouch, hold, walking, pause, drop and mobile layout. Existing panel QA and full life QA passed, including colors, reload and capacity. Vite production build passed (existing circular chunk/PDF eval notices).
- Skill client also exercised shark pickup. Its extra virtual clock produced a blank WebGL capture; adapted it to use the fixture-owned deterministic clock and rechecking the capture. Close-up crouch/cradle plus mobile screenshots from standard browser QA have been reviewed.
- Final skill capture fixed by retaining the fixture clock and enabling the tested software WebGL flags. Screenshot now clearly shows the user holding the shark; state confirms held phase and both hand targets, with no console/page errors. All requested work complete; refreshed preview opened.

2026-10-04 — Pet scene action wheel
- User wanted opening the cute panel to be one action; ordinary pet interactions should use the existing circular scene menu. Mesh clicks now open the shared action orbit, with panel/pet/carry/feed on page one and play/call/rest on page two. Panel and circle use one interaction entry; busy validation and live carry/drop labels retained. Panel opening closes the orbit.
- Extended arc point capacity to four and reserved a legible minimum size for small pet models. Menu tracks moving pet projection. Existing furniture pagination remains three.
- Restarted stopped local Vite preview on 5174. 22 relevant tests passed; wheel browser QA passed mesh picking, panel action, direct play, blocked physical-action feedback, mobile bounds and Escape. Desktop and mobile screenshots inspected with buttons fully visible after entrance animation. Full-home skill capture pending below.
- Full Home3DView skill capture completed: visible four-action pet orbit, model interaction state and no console/page errors. Preview ready.

2026-10-04 — Pet wheel reference styling: reused resident social wheel layout/petals, island cream/brown colors, separate labels and a compact back/page/next pill. Pet panel remains one action. Desktop/mobile browser QA and full Home3DView skill capture passed and screenshots inspected; direct actions still dispatch through existing pet interaction API.

2026-10-04 — 宠物接入家园日常与共用上下文：底栏日常旁新增宠物并撤下正式悬浮入口，沿用统一爪印。PetLife实际事件经petHomeRecord进journal/原家园回合投影；照顾取消不记完成，抱稳/落地各记一次，补食盆也进记录。ContextBuilder在家园定义旁从当前宠物存档注入姓名与物种，无独立近期宠物历史。31项回归通过，包含实际DB到私聊payload、改名隔离、抱持时序；390px浏览器验证底栏入口、喂食完成进入日常，无pageerror，报告output/home-life/pet-browser.json、截图pet-journal.png。

2026-10-04 — 家园角色表现与主动交谈
- 默认站姿增加轻微头部、胸肩呼吸摆动，脚底不位移；本地互动回应播放点头/挥手，在动画实际启动时记入日常，坐姿保留。
- 新增 HomePresenceBubbles：空闲时周期出现想象气泡，优先当前情绪 emoji。四个 OpenMoji SVG 随项目提供，授权与来源见 public/room3d/thoughts/ATTRIBUTION.txt。
- 当前房间累计 3 个本地角色动作、距离上轮/进入至少 90 秒，出现可点击金边邀请；180 秒冷却。未点击不请求 LLM。点击产生 presence/initiative 记录，沿用 HomeLifePanel、共享 ContextBuilder/记忆管线，不伪造用户台词。
- LLM 提示强调可执行动作白名单；无切换动作时实际播放轻量回应。模型话语、动作和触发前本地经历归同一回合；之后的本地行为开启下一回合。
- 说话分页软限 54 字，完整句可至 108 字，超长句再按分句/Unicode 上限分割；旧气泡 1.8 秒上浮淡出，新气泡保留完整尾句。空闲视图不重复更新 React state。
- 42 项测试通过，生产构建通过。独立 390×844 浏览器验证 OpenMoji 思考气泡、金边邀请点击前 0/点击后 1 次请求、回复及实际点头共用 turnId；未刷新用户正式页面。测试页 test/fixtures/home-presence.html，模型请求为本地 mock。

2026-10-04 — Explicit furniture control ownership
- Read-only live DOM diagnostic confirmed manual character-control was active (`controlled:true`); model/local action paths do not assign that control flag. Existing silent sticky mode made subsequent furniture clicks appear to target the wrong resident.
- Added persistent named character-control badge with a direct “切回自己” action; expanded wheel label to “操控 <名字>”. Centralized explicit control switching and exposed controlledResidentId in inspect. Switching back preserves the character’s seat and defers swapping until the user actually acts.
- 16 social wheel/role tests passed. 390px browser regression verified default user, explicit character seating, badge return to self, subsequent furniture seating uses user, seated floor clicks stay put, bystander never teleports; no page errors. output/home-life/control-browser.json.

2026-10-04 — Conversation partner gaze
- Conversations and local nod/wave responses now gently turn standing characters toward the actual user head position; seated/lying roots stay anchored and only bounded head gaze changes. Body2 resolves target in the head parent's coordinates; classic head mesh/hair have matching limited yaw.
- Solo social greetings receive a partner-facing stage orientation; paired/contact motions retain captured headings and contact geometry.
- 14 baseline focused tests passed; additional single-versus-paired facing regression added. Mobile browser verifies standing heading dot > .99, no root translation, seated root/yaw unchanged and no page errors. Screenshots facing-standing.png/facing-seated.png inspected. No LLM calls or context changes.

2026-10-04 — Persistent invitation and independent resident actions
- Gold invitation now latches once offered, remains pending through busy/activity/panel state, and returns when its owner is visible again. Moved closer to head; separate cross dismisses with cooldown without calling the model; listen still explicitly consumes invitation. Presence tests cover busy, disabled panel, absence/reappearance and close.
- User-only furniture, floor movement and pet interaction no longer increment the character interruption revision. Actor-slot swaps rebind ongoing companion travel/gesture roots, preserve parked character motion/activity and no longer cancel phone/wander on restoration. Parked furniture animation and its normal local duration are retained.
- Mobile browser verified character phone continues while user sits; persistent invitation survives phone start and cross makes zero LLM calls. Screenshots inspected. Full kitchen/watering prop concurrency is not covered by this regression; these still share scene-level effects and need separate multi-resident activity runtime work.

2026-10-04 — User resident natural idle
- Non-active visible residents now tick the same visitor idle animation as the main character. The loop also keeps rendering when only the user is visible in a room; respects existing frame caps, quality motion setting, suspended/edit/overview and reduced-motion preferences.
- Excludes the parked character (its independent activity loop owns it) and social sessions; the actively controlled user's seating/walking/furniture animation remains on its existing path.
- 12 relevant motion/role tests passed. Mobile control regression checks seated user stays seated under floor clicks, paired completion retains positions and bystanders do not teleport. Skill capture in output/home-life/user-idle-skill.

2026-10-04 — Reciprocal local interaction gaze
- Local character nod/wave responses now also orient the idle user toward the character. Seated/lying user roots stay fixed and use bounded head gaze; walking, posture transitions, active furniture/held-object/pet actions retain their own animation ownership.
- Solo social interactions orient the listening resident toward the speaker; self-category actions and all paired contact clips are excluded. No model invocation is involved.
- Added residentHeadings to existing editor inspector. Nine facing/social-role tests passed; real mobile fixture local-response test verifies both residents face one another (dot > .99) with positions unchanged, no page errors or LLM call. Screenshot local-reciprocal.png.

2026-10-04 — Seated shoulder rub and mixed-posture hugs
- Shoulder rub approaches from behind the seated recipient and preserves their heading/seat anchor. Standing actor uses the same heading; blocked rear approach reports lack of space rather than placing the actor in front. Rear spacing clears the seat footprint.
- home-hug supports standing/seated in either actor order, rejects two seated or lying actors. Keeps the seated root/legs anchored, approaches with the standing actor, uses upper-body hug with a slight standing lean, and retains seated posture afterward.
- 24 social/posture/intimacy tests passed, including reversed seated actor and rotated headings. Browser QA verified seated recipient remains fixed during/after hugging and shoulder rub; rear-blocked showroom rejects correctly, isolated clear seat succeeds with matching rear heading. No page errors. Screenshots in output/home-life/seated-*.png; game skill capture inspected in seated-social-skill. Reverse seated-user coverage is automated runtime tests, not a separate browser scenario.

2026-10-04 — User speech gestures and explicit chat cancellation reasons
- Sending a new user utterance starts a bounded local speaking gesture (3–12 seconds) on the user visitor, with reciprocal conversation gaze. Keeps root positions, preserves seated lower body and skips lying/transition/busy furniture/contact animations. Regeneration/retry does not replay the original user gesture. Disposal clears the session.
- HomeLifePanel remains mounted while the 3D surface is suspended, hiding only its sheet. Pending requests no longer abort solely because the surface is temporarily hidden. True unmount, explicit stop, edited history and timeout now supply named cancellation reasons; UI shows that reason.
- Original 5.6-second AbortError cannot be conclusively attributed retrospectively: old cancellation sites omitted reasons. It was not the explicit 120-second panel timeout. User confirmed context/token volume is expected; no context-range or prompt truncation changes made.
- 15 panel/facing tests passed including hide/reopen pending request and named manual stop. Browser QA confirmed loaded user speech, reciprocal facing, unchanged positions and session expiry; user-speech.png inspected. Adapted skill capture rerun.

2026-10-04 — Nearby gaze, opt-in direct speech, thoughts, event rows and emotion updates
- Added idle nearby reciprocal gaze (3.2 scene units), preserving roots and action ownership. Direct speech setting persists on home state and keeps the existing initiative/cooldown guard; automatic prompt and journal distinguish it from clicking an invitation.
- Expanded thoughts to twelve everyday emoji and rotation through enabled buffs, 6 seconds per 16-second cycle. Event records use quiet timeline rows; spoken messages retain bubbles. Removed routine footsteps at emission and from historical context/initiative eligibility; meaningful approaches remain.
- Successful home replies share private-chat emotion evaluator/persistence and API/gates; failure, cancellation and regeneration skip. Current buffs shown in chat panel.
- 27 focused tests passed, followed by 5 initiative/presence tests after excluding old walking records. Isolated browser verified saved setting, transparent event rows, one automatic local mocked request with correct prompt, reciprocal nearby gaze without position changes. Screenshots inspected: direct-speech-settings.png, event-record-style.png, nearby-gaze.png and adapted game skill capture. No production LLM requests or manual refresh of user tab.
- Full-project tsc did not finish in the validation window; no claim of full typecheck success.

2026-10-04 — Portrait opens live shared emotion buffs
- Main character portrait retains camera centering and opens the mood sheet via the existing home menu. Shows emoji, name, intensity and description; distinguishes disabled feature from no active buffs. User portrait remains camera-only.
- Removed the chat header mood strip so the avatar is the dedicated visual entry. Reads the same CharacterProfile.activeBuffs; no second mood store or model call on viewing.
- Verified shared evaluator persistence broadcasts emotion-updated to OSContext and useHomeEmotion, connecting chat state and local behavior. 21 panel/evaluation/behavior tests passed, including live buff prop updates and disabled gate. Isolated browser screenshot avatar-mood.png inspected; close/open test uses mocked fixture, not user's production chat.

2026-10-04 — 一坐一站的二号拥抱改为跪姿抱腰腹、侧头、坐着方摸头。按用户近景反馈错开四只手：环腰贴左右侧，摸头提前，空闲手放身侧偏后。37项相关测试通过，包含不同身高与换位、膝脚地面、坐位保留、双掌间距。已核对正反近景与动作过渡，浏览器无报错；集成生产构建通过（39.70 秒，保留现有大分块提示）。

2026-10-04 — Permit temporary furniture overlap during social motion
- Split social clearance into approach, animation sweep, and completion footprint checks. Editor allows furniture overlap only during the animation sweep; structural walls/floor bounds and bystanders remain checked. Navigation and end positions retain furniture clearance. Other runtime consumers retain strict fallback when canPerform is absent.
- 22 social/facing tests passed, including phase separation and rejection of blocked approach/end/motion bounds. Real mobile fixture regression completed with no page errors: seated floor clicks remain inert, both-user control ownership preserved, paired completion stable, and bystanders do not teleport. Adapted skill and control screenshots inspected.

2026-10-04 — Independent local companionship and automatic speech controls
- Moved automatic speech from home settings to immediately below autonomous activity in My Home. Each switch is independent; local activity frequency quiet/normal/lively and speech interval often/normal/quiet (2/5/10 minutes) persist in home state.
- Automatic speech uses idle same-room user presence and conversation-reset elapsed interval, independent of local autonomy or action count. Existing user-click invitation behavior remains when automatic speech is off. Busy/hidden/absent gates and one-request consumption remain.
- Local companionship now loads only existing policy caches and structured/cached emotional motion bias; no fallback semantic API calls from those local hooks. Explicit conversation still uses the shared emotion evaluation pipeline.
- 21 options/initiative/panel tests passed plus six local-only policy/emotion tests; browser confirms separate toggles, all selected values and persistence on reopening, no page errors. companion-options.png inspected; game skill runner invoked.

2026-10-04 — 补齐样板房厨房中岛吃饭：按已有中岛/朝向长凳/早餐托盘识别，不改存档，无需 dockId；三处家具入口与目录动作说明接通。吃饭坐点前移 0.15，临时饭碗位于台面前沿。27 项吃饭/家具/厨房/手部测试通过，实际二号走近入座、侧视吃饭、结束留坐并清道具验收，浏览器无报错，集成构建通过（22.96s）。额外目录测试原有 bath_washer 仍期待空动作，但当前已有洗衣，故 1 项旧断言失败；未改该无关测试。截图 output/kitchen-eating/{close,side}.png。

## 2026-10-04 自动开口恢复原始触发规则
- 按最新要求取消自动开口频率选择，恢复至少 3 次有效自主行为、进入/上次回复后 90 秒、主动邀请间隔 180 秒；本地活动频率仍保留。
- RoomApp 显式传递当前 App 活跃状态；退出家园或页面隐藏后停止自动触发，并取消仍在等待的自动请求。手动交流不因临时面板隐藏而取消。
- 设置补充触发条件和离开后停止调用的说明，同步 room3d 文档。
- 验证：homeInitiative、homePresenceBubbles、homeLifePanel 共 18 项测试通过；隔离浏览器检查开关独立保存、重新打开保持状态、自动开口无频率选择，无页面错误。截图 output/home-life/restored-initiative.png 已检查。


## 2026-10-04 统一情绪上下文
- ContextBuilder 默认关闭情绪注入，仅 chat/home 且角色功能开启时统一注入 buff 与共享 innerState。轻量 emotionState 模块复用原缓存键，避免引入评估管线循环依赖。
- 私聊/主动私聊改读共享最新状态；innerState 脱离日程注入，显式空字符串用于重生成屏蔽旧状态。
- 家园评估与主回复并行，使用相同输入；重生成清除请求内旧 buff/innerState 后重新评估。
- 8 个测试文件、64 项测试通过，包含默认关闭、跨入口共享、无日程注入、一次注入、重生成、家园主回复待返回时评估已启动。未调用真实付费 API。

2026-10-04 — 用户 Meshy zip 四款兽耳替换。import-meshy-ears.mjs 去源贴图/UV，自编几何遮罩配色并减面：狐狸整对 3876，猫狗兔各 3900 三角面；新 meshy-ears.glb 共用 48 骨 head 绑定，保留 ID/毛色耳内染色/版型，尾巴不变。四张缩略图更新，实际捏人器四款切换截图 output/meshy-ears/worn-*.png，无浏览器错误。11 项资产配色回归通过、接入检查 4 款×4姿势零数据失败，衣橱生产构建通过。源 SHA256 与原/最终面数在 art/chibi/meshy-ears-report.json；原始 zip 保留 Downloads，解压中间文件 output/meshy-ears/source。

2026-10-04 — 毛色一键取当前发色与预览手势：GarmentColors 读取头发图层不透明主色，只改 fur，支持原撤销/保存。HairEditor 去旋转滑杆，单指旋转、双指平移缩放、滚轮缩放/Shift平移，Puppet镜头保留自动构图叠加视图偏移，复位归零。实际浏览器验证取色#c4834b、旋转、滚轮、复位通过，无报错；衣橱构建通过29.70s，截图output/meshy-ears/controls.png。


## 2026-10-04 日程统一进入 ContextBuilder
- 核心、实时块和轻量角色上下文改为异步入口，统一按角色日历日读取日程；所有生产调用点及同步 prompt helper 改为 await。像素家园改为每次请求时组装，而非渲染时缓存。
- 全入口遵守角色日程总开关，false/skipMemories 不影响日程。保留时间感知对钟点的控制。不存在日程不生成、不额外调用 API。
- 私聊删除重复日程段，worker fire-pack 延后至执行时注入，音乐仍使用独立的日程读取。情绪范围不变。
- 验证：核心与各入口回归 113 项通过；补充日程/时区/宠物 25 项通过（包含重复覆盖）。Vite 生产构建成功。全仓 tsc 长时间未产出结果已中止，不视为通过。

2026-10-04 — 校园风1按用户新JSON完整替换；兽尾无手动fur时默认继承已穿兽耳毛色，预览与家园同一解析路径。面饰分组列出7面纹/17配饰，整组高低/左右/大小/旋转控制，正式页和独立衣橱页接通（独立页新增选件桥与历史快照）。19项相关测试通过；浏览器验证新套装参数、24个入口、多选取件、位置保存/撤销，无报错，衣橱构建17.93s通过。修正旧动物测试对网格数量/首顶点位置的假设，改按服装ID与外缘点验证头骨跟随。


## 2026-10-04 私聊日程单次读取
- 每次 prompt 组装共用本轮 schedulePromise，ContextBuilder 与音乐氛围不再各查一次；空结果也复用，下一轮重新读取。
- fire-pack 模板不读取本地日程供音乐使用，保持 worker 现场渲染路径。
- 36 项相关测试通过，包含每轮一次、下一轮更新、空日程不重读和 fire-pack 回归。

2026-10-04 — 配饰入口可见性修正：面饰内改顶部并列『面纹/配饰』分类（带数量），避免17款配饰埋在面纹与滑杆之后。选择体型始终显示『所有角色都会使用这款体型，包括你和来访角色』。浏览器核对17款、点选切换及提示，无错误，截图output/meshy-ears/accessory-tabs.png。

2026-10-04 — 吃饭穿头与双人座位：脸前握勺目标替代头骨中心，勺子接掌心完整旋转，餐边凳加宽到2.8并设±.85两个位置。补另一角色独立碗勺、占位和结束清理。28项测试、对照页构建及实际浏览器吃饭/结束流程通过；双人截图在output/kitchen-eating/。

2026-10-04 — Home phone photo mode
- Replaced direct capture entry with frozen portrait session, independent per-resident pose/time/yaw, temporary side-by-side staging, camera orbit/pitch/zoom/height, and screen-space neon/glow/fringe/vignette/exposure baked into PNG. Temporary transforms/camera restored on close; no photo activity in journal. Deferred schedule relocation and blocked autonomous actions while frozen.
- Two photoSession tests passed. Isolated Edge mobile QA verifies two actors, pose, preview/export canvas, exact restored root positions, no page errors. Skill client smoke and mobile screenshots inspected. Formal user tab not navigated/refreshed.

2026-10-04 — Home phone AMSG2 audit
- Confirmed shared instant route and home prompt in fire_pack.chat; scheduled renderer stays separate. Fixed pending indicator ending at local 202 handoff, including pending restoration/storage synchronization. Registered embedded reader for OS unread/toast and generation banner suppression without OS navigation changes.
- 132 targeted tests passed; isolated browser tests pending handoff/storage clear and unread repeated vibration/read stop. No actual user Worker request/deploy performed.

2026-10-04 — Correct photo gestures and stronger bloom
- Removed deprecated procedural wave/wave-cute from photo picker/runtime; uses approved selected wave and wave-response clips, request version guards and exit cancellation. Glow range 0–3 with colour-preserving highlight extraction and three blur radii; capped colour-leak alpha.

2026-10-04 — Approved photo library + illustration looks
- 14 approved poses01/03 exported with source hash checks and full finite tracks; 42 production actions (21 solo / 21 paired), searchable dedicated photo panel. Paired freezes reuse social contact/props; switch restores staging before next action. Fixed default photo framing. Added 夏日手绘 / 晴空物语 grading, documented screen-space scope.
- All 56 assets applied and rendered in isolated Edge with no errors; source selection and restore tests pass (4). Reviewed peace and paired screenshots.
- User canceled home-phone chat action execution. No changes to chat/Worker action directives were made. Phone remains normal messaging with phone-holding animation.

2026-10-04 — Photo controls and per-resident expressions
- Removed static pose UI, distinct pair actor selection, adjacent collapse control, direct orbit/pinch/wheel, temporary original preview.
- Added per-person facial expression and camera gaze; render-scoped head rotation and original face restoration on exit.
- Five photo unit tests passed; isolated Edge checked expressions/gaze/exit, paired selection, controls and 56 runtime assets; Vite build passed. User tab not refreshed.

2026-10-04 — Water handover and sipping grip
- Replaced the solid capped water cylinder with a hollow ceramic cup, rounded rim, green band and recessed water surface. Added a two-role waterGrip controller: wrapped fingers, thumb below rim, upright passing, blended handover targets, and a rim-to-mouth sip/tip/release phase. Prop transform follows the solved supporting wrist; removed generic palm-to-palm contact for this action. Phone grip remains unchanged.
- Validation: chibiWaterGrip/chibiSocialProps/chibiSocial 22 tests passed, including transformed scene parents and mixed body heights. Social fixture Vite build passed (existing chunk size warning). Browser inspected closeups at source 1/2.25/2.27/3/5.7 seconds, no page errors; handover samples move ~2.8cm over 20ms. QA in output/water-grip. Applies to shared social runtime, not a fixture-only patch.

2026-10-04 — Home followups and stalled reply handling
- Default wardrobe layering on for unspecified values, pet portrait rail and summon-all, schedule header and forced schedule placement on reentry. Photo screen-relative pan and single thin-scroll control area.
- Added cancellable stage awaits and per-stage request UI/timeouts. Matched ChatApp local ordering: main fetch starts then emotion evaluation runs concurrently on identical messages. No recall skipped. Previous timeout's exact stage unavailable in historical logs.
- 43 targeted tests plus 21 final tests passed (overlapping suites); isolated Edge verified pet entry, summon, schedule label, pan and scroll; reviewed screenshots. Final Vite build passed. No paid API calls triggered.

2026-10-04 — Photo filter library
- Set requested daylight default (0.55 / 0.60 / 0.12 / 1.02); named local filter snapshots with apply, remove and undo, validated stored values and surfaced storage errors.
- Browser verified default values, save/apply/reopen persistence, remove/undo. Vite build passed; resolved Windows case-insensitive module-name collision by using distinct storage/component basenames.

2026-10-04 — Local pet companionship
- Pet portrait thoughts, idle-pet candidates, character-owned pet/play contact with approach and completion-only attribution. User contact behavior preserved; no extra LLM call.
- Browser verified character approach/contact and journal attribution with unchanged user position; unit tests cover selection, source/bond ownership, cancellation and pet thought display. Build passed.

2026-10-04 — Bed leisure gating and emotion timing
- Bed leisure requires an already settled matching bed; stale commands are rejected.
- Added context-stage and emotion-module timing; concurrent reply/emotion banner exposes both states. Live no-refresh observation: context read ~6.27s, recall ~3.94s, emotion evaluator begins ~0.10s after main dispatch.
- 14 focused tests passed.

2026-10-04 — Incremental home history / model bed actions
- Replaced per-save full chat cursor scan with changed-turn indexed writes; migration uses source index and subsequent checks are read-only. 69 context/bridge/parser/panel tests passed, including immediately queued context reads.
- Preserve both residents furniture posture across actor swaps; keep model action list when user lies down and exclude occupied beds. Added explicit action selection/execution diagnostics.

2026-10-04 — Ordered model action plans
- actionIds parsing, conditional full action catalog, sequential executor with actor/target posture prerequisites and retained seated/lying states.
- Browser verified phone auto-lie → both rise → hug, and auto-seat → seated action → rise → bed phone.
- Additional browser pass: user automatically sits for shoulder interaction while character rises. Panel regression caught and fixed the old single-action gate; ordered-plan submission now tested explicitly.

2026-10-05 — Pet scheduled sleep: local home-time 22:00–08:00 / low energy prefers reachable rest mats then reviewed low beds. Added actual hop-up/sleep/hop-down, wake-before-interaction, sleep spot claims and lifecycle guards; no API. Pet sleep/life/contact tests: 25 passed. Isolated browser confirms bed surface and morning descent; screenshot output/home-life/pet-sleep-bed.png.
